It’s the BEST I’ve tried for covering acne marks and I’ve tried it ALL (Nars, MUFE, Estée Lauder, Laurier Mercier) you name it! Also a little goes a LONG way! It’s for the oily folks, I think it would be too drying for someone with dry skin. I think it’s too full coverage/drying for around the eye but I also don’t like a lot of concealer around the eye, gets cakey.",

My under-eyes immediately became red and patchy. I had just started a new mascara too so I wasn't certain what did it. I phased out both and then tried to implement this back in and it is definitely the culprit. I think it's one of these four ingredients that are in teh concealer but not the foundation: Alcohol, Hydrogenated Styrene/Isoprene Copolymer, Hydroxyacetophenone, Combretum Fruticosum Flower Nectar.",

I prepare my skin previously with a lot of moisturizing creams, and double prime my face with my hydrating primer. As I wear it during the day it lasts a lot and leaves a really matte finish so I give it points for that, but it points out a little my eye lines. \nI'm going to try to buy another hydrating primer, because it was really expensive for what I got.",

I also love a nice creamy brightening concealer. Let me tell you, this did not disappoint, I was so happy with it. My face looked instantly lifted, and my under eyes were creamily concealed.

I’m already wants to see her again and this is my new favorite concealer! When I have dry skin will blend some gentle moisturizing cream would be working. Before I forget have to write what Andrea suggested. When I apply this 190 concealer will be brighten up around eyes also T-zones. My original color is 210 but it will melting my skin tone and more visible my dark spot more. Using lighter color will help keep covering wherever you want keep invisible.

Maybe if I got the Fenty setting powder it’ll work but I’m not about to spend more money for extra powders just for my eyes.\n\nIt’s not really dry as everyone is saying in my opinion and I do have dry skin, it’s very creamy and fun to play with when I first set it down and a little goes a long way but I notice I lose a significant amount of coverage through the day. It makes me look like my mascara ran down when I know that’s not the case. The darkness under my eyes begin to peek within 2 hours of wearing it and I love everything except for the fact that it just cannot set whatsoever. And god forbid I need to wipe off a spec of eyeshadow under my eye or I want to pat down my eyes, well then product will definitely swipe onto my fingers. \n\nIt also creases as soon as I finish blending it in - where as my elf and rare beauty concealer don’t crease until later on in the day which is reasonable considering how my undereye area already naturally has a folded crease. The color was also perfect, 185 looks amazing on olive skin tones. I will finish the bottle since I can’t return but I wouldn’t  buy it again, was worth a try.",

I wouldn't recommend for people with major redness or acne.\n\nThe formula is creamy and easy to apply for sure! No strong smell.

You can see in my photo that the two major blemishes on my forehead are “covered” color-wise (they’re red pimples) but you can still clearly find them on my face because of the dry flakes around them that only show up when I wear this concealer.

So when I ran out of my shape tape, which I was actually very pleased with, I just wanted to try this one because maybe the *perfect* concealer does exist? Big mistake and now I cant return it.\n\nThe worst part is how horribly it creases. Im talking like, if I just applied it and then squint a little to put on my eyeliner next, it’s extremely noticeable in the tiniest lines or facial expressions you make. Maybe it’s unrealistic to expect a liquid substance to not settle into creases eventually, but then again, they’re the ones making these claims to sell their product. And I've definitely tried better.. I'm so glad we have reviews now to call them out on it. Secondary issues are: It just looks really fake and paint like, I cant explain why it just does. The concealer is supposed to be coordinated with the foundation but I find it way too bright in comparison. Maybe its the white cast others were mentioning. It really exaggerates the slightest texture just like the foundation which I sadly purchased at the same time. It moves around and breaks up, hardly lasting more than a few hours, even though I always set it with powder. I have oily skin but not right under my eyes, more like the T-zone area which of course doesn’t stand a chance with this stuff. And I’ve never had dry spots which this makes it look like I do.\n\nI'm bummed I fell for the hype and thinking that since Rihanna seems to have some integrity and generally exudes quality, maybe her makeup line would reflect that. But I think I'll stick with real cosmetics companies from now on, who have been in the game way longer, and their entire reputation depends on their products, not the other way around. Save your money because this is worth $5 on a good day.",

Texture, creasing, pores, the whole nine. My pores are big and when I was using on my under eye, the concealer would just settle in and seemed to make them more noticeable. Was not a fan. In all, I know its limitations and use accordingly. Would I recommend this? No. Most people want their concealers to do it all and for $26, rightfully so. This concealer is not that.

After an hour or two, this concealer would pick up on the oil in my skin and start to get streaky and clump together, so much so that I’d have to go into the bathroom and try to smear it back into place with my hands.

My beef with this product is that is does not settle nicely on the skin, I have fine lines under my eyes and the concealer accentuated those lines. To add, it creases! I hadn't even set my concealer with my Laura Mercier powder and I already noticed the concealer creasing even though I had primed my skin prior. Also, I have oily skin and the concealer gives you a matte finish so throughout the day my skin was oily but my under eyes were matte and it just made my entire face of makeup look off. I had tried the matchstix and that was even worse so when this new concealer came in I was pretty excited to try it, I returned it immediately. I guess some positives are that the formula is very rich so you can get good coverage and also, a little goes a long way. Overall, I would not recommend this concealer I think the NARS radiant concealer is a better option and it's what I chose instead.",

While it is very low on the ingredient list, if you are like me and acne prone, with skin that flares/breakouts with nearly anything known to be comedogenic, Talc is one of the worst for your skin. I liked the coverage of this and the color, and also it lasted. But after I could just tell my skin was worse as the day went on. I am shade 310 in the foundation but a 330 for this.  I would recommend to those who don’t have sensitive or acne prone skin only.",

This is the first higher end concealer I ever bought and it's one of the only purchases I truly regret. This concealer just isn't right for me.

It's unusable as a concealer for me, so I try to use it as a primer to get my moneys worth out of it. Not bad as a primer, since my eyelids are a little more oily than my under eyes. My takeaway is if you have drier under eyes this product might not be for you.",

I used this product for a while and thought I was having dietary problems (my moms a celiac so I thought it was something hereditary, it also didn't happen over night so that's why I didn't suspect this being the culprit).  I changed my entire diet and no improvements.  I read into other people having the same issues with Fenty, so I stopped using it immediately, and haven't had a new pimple since and my face has started to clear dramatically (Besides the deep scarring it caused)  I wish this product worked for me, the formula was beautiful on and the coverage was amazing, but It wasn't worth ruining my face over unfortunately..",

I'm very oily, not a dry spot on my face especially under my eyes. I've tried applying this with a wet and dry sponge, a foundation brush, a concealer brush, and my fingers on top of the matte fenty foundation. I've tried using it straight outta the tube, mixed with a color corrector, mixed with a primer, mixed with an oil and nothing helps. Not only is it patchy but it removes the Fenty foundation beneath and leaves my under eyes looking dry. I've used the Fenty concealer brush and that doesn't help and I've used the Fenty primer along with Milk hydrogrip and neither improve this foundation. Returning immediately.",

I have oily skin and she has dry.. this was the verdict \n\nMy friends Dry skin: it’s caked, creased and patched off any dry areas in my friend in 1 minute... it just couldn’t stick to her dry under eyes and the creasing was so bad. She said it’s the worst concealer she ever tried\n\nMy oily skin: it stuck to my skin well but it creased and NEVER DRIED DOWN NO MATTER HOW MUCH I BAKED.. THE CONCEALER WAS WET. It has NOOO dry time at all because it DOES NOT SET WHATSOEVER. It would look really good on me but I had to do so much for it to look good because the coverage was medium no matter how much I built it up. I would need to powder constantly because the dewy formula would eat up the powder because it never set\n\n It’s a dewy concealer but NOT hydrating ..  the most useless concealer . What’s the point of being dewy if you aren’t going to stick and act well on dehydrated skin? \n\nI have been reading reviews of people saying it dried down too fast.. it doesn’t dry down, it just sticks to the skin and is Hard to blend... that’s what they are most likely experiencing. \nI give it 2 stars because it seems like people with Normal skin like it but if you are oily and dry.. stay away. This doesn’t blur texture or pores... way better concealers at Sephora",

The coverage and shade match is the best I've ever seen and it's amazing for covering hyperpigmentation. I have to say though, the formula is a bit drying so I can see why people who are using it for eyes are giving it a low rating.",

I may get one more shade just to give me a lift whenever I want to brighten for a particular look and event. I love that it doesn't have the chemical smell like other products.

Great on oily skin too, typically hard to find a natural concealer with oily skin since it usually will be too slippery on my face, but this is perfect. Definitely my favorite concealer so far!!

I've tried various tips and tricks to help prevent it from creasing/sliding off because I think it would be convenient to have my concealer and foundation both from Fenty, but unfortunately nothing worked. Although this formula didn't work for me personally, this match to the foundation is the perfect shade lighter. It also initially goes on nice and creamy, so it does have a nice texture.

I typically use tarte shape tape under my eyes and that works really well for me. I can warm a dot of this Fenty one up between my fingers and Pat it overtop my shape tape and it creates a really nice shade and a little additional coverage.

Doesn’t brighten the face, and it’s incredibly thick so you have to blend this almost immediately. Once it’s set though, it does NOT come off. And it does have amazing coverage. Also, creaseless? PFFFFtttt. Let’s be real... our skin moves and stretches, and makeup is going to move with it. I dont recommend this for someone with mature skin, or dry skin. It does cling to dry spots a little bit. Over all, amazing coverage, just wish it wasn’t darker than the foundation. Another plus is there is nooo flashback!!!!",

I accentuates texture and fine lines. It dries so quickly so you need to blend fast. I just cannot make this stuff work. Under my eyes, I feel it ages me. Over blemishes it tends to make them look worse than just not covering them. The best I can get it to look is when I have a super duper hydrated base. I take product off on the back of my hand. I take the tiniest, and I mean tiniest, amount of product and use the fenty concealer brush and work as fast as I can buffing it in. The one thing I can day is when this stuff is on, it stays on.

While it says the undertones are neutral, they're definitely on the pinky side. My only problem would be that it does tend to crease a bit, which I have never experienced with other concealers. It's not super noticeable though, and I'm sure this could be fixed with some powder. Also, sometimes the skin on my cheeks gets dry due to my acne medication and it ends up looking really flaky. I don't think this formula would be ideal for someone with super dry skin.\nThe formula is thick, but can be sheered out if you use a damp beauty blender. I usually apply it with my fingers (like I do for all my makeup!) and it works just fine. I usually only put it around my under eyes, but I have successfully covered acne spots with it before :)",

I really liked the way it looked on my forehead and chin so I think that’s all I will be using it for. In addition to the concealer I also bought the soft matte foundation. I love that the concealer and foundation are matching numbers and they go perfect with each other. Overall I will definitely be using this up, but I probably won’t repurchase.

This concealer works well for eye/eyebrow makeup and concealing dark circles or blemishes. It's not too heavy and goes on smoothly. It blends perfectly into my foundation and I'll probably continue purchasing this concealer from now on. I honestly thought I might have to go a darker or lighter color when I ordered this, but it matched perfectly with foundation. The container wasn't too large considering the price, I thought there would be more but the formula is very nice so I don't mind this tiny setback. I didn't need to apply a lot of concealer in the first place so you won't waste much of the product.",

This is THAT versatile product & my new favourite! I LOVE this concealer! \nThe 120 matches my light combination skin perfectly for simple coverage of dark circles & spots for every day while still working really well with at least 3 other brands/types of foundation that are my Go To products. It is buildable, blends out easily(prefer using beauty blenders for concealing) & doesn't have a strong added fragrance. It also stays where I put it, especially when set, only when I wash my makeup off but not before. I also really like to use the lighter shade 110 for brightening & natural face light/lift effect. I would absolutely buy more shades to use as contour since the shade range is so easy to match re undertones & works brilliantly with powder & cream products without compromising coverage either. Fenty scored with this product no question!",

This concealer is very very VERY creamy and it likes to move around. At the same time though, it dries fast when applying. This concealer also likes to grip onto any dry skin or flaky skin so moisturizer and cleanse before application or it’ll cling to your dry skin. This concealer definitely needs setting powder because otherwise it slides and creases, so I don’t recommend this for a simple apply and out the door look. Truthfully this needs the Fenty Powder to work well, and that powder is the sole reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 although it is frustrating it needs something else to be as perfect as it can be.",

A little goes a long way with this one, whereas with the nars concealer I had to build up coverage wherever I needed it. I have combo skin and it looks great on both oilier and drier sides of my face. It has good staying power and does't seem to wear off in strange ways.

I go back and forth from this concealer and shape tape but for my everyday look, i definitely use Fenty",

I have what I guess some might call a dry-ish eye area, and a very low-maintenance skincare and make-up routine.  Concealer is something I wear on days when I am too tired for my tinted moisturizer to mask the dark circles.  I don't prime my face with primers, just facial oil.  This concealer is not for those with combination/dry skin and a no-fuss skin and make-up regimen.  I feel like for this to look good, I have to spend a lot of time prepping and moisturizing my skin with masks and other things that I just don't have the time for.  As it stands, this concealer separates, settles into my lines and pores, and is quite drying.  I am thirty and look about 5 years younger without makeup, but this aged my skin by about 10 years.  Not happy with this for my skin.  Going to try something moisturizing.",

I don’t find it to look particularly drying on my oily skin, so much as it accentuates “crepeyness” on the undereyes and clings to dry spots and blemishes when put on bare skin. Though it’s the best shade match I’ve ever found, I would not spot conceal with this. However, when I’m doing a whole foundation and setting powder routine, I still find myself reaching for this for highlighting my undereyes, nose, and forehead because I really like how this texture blends out, even on top of pretty matte foundations.",

I had been used to the Too Faced Born This Way Multi-Use Sculpting Concealer so I wanted to switch things up. After applying the concealer to areas of need (under eyes and red areas), I used my makeup sponge and it appeared to blend very well. The color I chose is perfect for my skin - no yellow/orange tint to it either which I appreciate. I am giving this a 4 out of 5 because it appears that it does crease a bit toward the end of the day - whereas my old concealer did not. Maybe I need to apply it a different way, or put some more setting powder on it!",

This will not cover up any acne or spot conceal, but the brightening effect is very beautiful.

        "review_text": "First off, THANK YOU RIHANNA for all the shades!! I am a Bengali, tan skinned woman with heavy dark under eye circles. After trying HUNDREDS of concealers in the past 15  years, aside from my Nars concealer (shade “caramel”), this is the only concealer which has my shade! No more color correcting nor multiple color mixing needed! HALLELUJAH!!! I mean it almost feels like a dream, like whaaaat, is it actually possible that a makeup company has my shade?? Is this even real life..? That’s how I felt when I first tried this concealer. Nars has my shade too, but the problem with that concealer is that, it is not long lasting on me, even after I set it with powder. But this Fenty concealer (shade 360), OMG GUYS THIS CONCEALER IS EVERYTHING!! Not only does it match me PERFECTLY, but it LASTS ALL DAY. In fact, it looks BETTER throughout the day!!! However, please note that it only lasts when you set the under eye with the Fenty setting powder (shade “Banana”). Not any other other powder, not even the Laura Mercier one, but ONLY this one. And together, they truly become this miracle product! Don’t listen to the bad reviews guys. I feel like the bad reviews I have seen, is cause they don’t set this concealer with the Fenty powder, or they may set it using too much powder. But truly, if set the correct way, with the correct powder, this concealer performs amazingly! You’ll never wanna buy/try another concealer powder combo again!",

Not a single crease or crack, literally just like how it looked yesterday after application. Yes my mascara has smeared sideways and my eyeshadow is almost gone but this concealer is ready for another day and almost makes me want to not wash it off now lol also wearing the new hydrating foundation formula and it’s stayed in place as well, no transfer to my pillow at all, and my highlighter still blinging like I just put it on too.

It’s a bit cheaper and also thicker so it covers my bags much better with less product, in fact I now use it instead of foundation because it blends so well into my skin. I do want to try the foundation again as I found the shade I bought to be too dark (410) especially since I find concealer shade 380 to be the perfect match for my skin rather than lighter for brightening. I had asked an employee to shade match, but once I told her I wore 410 she swatched it on me and said it matches..so I found that to be a bit useless. Regardless, great product.",

And let me tell you I don’t have a lot of under eye wrinkles! As far as coverage it’s ok, not full coverage but definitely a medium coverage. I’ve used the shade in 150 and 120, and there is a noticeable difference in the consistency of the two. I don’t know if it’s a coincidence or a formula change, however I liked the thicker consistency. Is it a HG? No I think it’s time to find something else.",

This concealer in my experience accentuated every fine line under my eyes, and would not set and immediately crease upon application no matter what method I used. At first I thought it was simply the fault of my under eyes. However after trying different concealers (such as Too Faced’s Born This Way which I now love!) I had to accept that it was in fact the Fenty concealer. :( I definitely would not recommend if you have problematic under eyes as this will make them look crepey, but am leaving two stars for if you are using it elsewhere on your face as it IS creamy and on the thicker side which can be great for concealing blemishes, discoloration, etc. And in my opinion using concealer for under your eyes vs your face are two very different kinds of use!",

At first, when using this concealer in those areas, I saw a lot of caking and creasing happening, which wasn't cute. It aged me! But then I saw a trick online for the laugh lines specifically to apply foundation or concealer first and then wipe away (in the creases specifically) with a Q-tip or something, and then blend with your finger. I've been using this trick every day and it has made a great difference! It is very noticeable when I forget to wipe my laugh lines. So I've applied the same technique to the other crease lines and wrinkles on my face when using this concealer and it works just fine. I also am a fan of natural looks so I find that less is more. The more concealer you use, the bigger the opportunity for caking. So be smart with how you apply this concealer and you'll be fine :)",

I mix it with the Fenty primer.  Use a brush/finger to apply thene a wet sponge to blend out the edges.  Then set with a very small amount of powder on the sponge.

I feel like you could get a way better concealer from just the drug store. All my friends who have it don’t really like it either.

The deal breaker for me between these 3 concealers is that Fenty came is the perfect shade for my skin.  Sometimes I just like to wear concealer down the middle of my face instead of a full face of foundation and the shade 250 matched my skin perfectly.  I couldn't even detect it in daylight; it blended in seamlessly into my skin.  I set this with Charlotte  Tilbury powder.  Like all concealers this did crease around my mouth so I took 1 star off for that.  Shout out to the Sephora make up artist who I was kind of hesitant to listen to because he looked like a punk rocker with multiple piercings and tattoos, but he was amazing and picked out the perfect shade for me.  I have combination, mostly oily skin.",

There I was five minutes before leaving to the wedding, in the bathroom scrubbing this concealer off my dress. (I was the maid of honor). It would NOT come off.

        "review_text": "I’m officially in love with this concealer. I have extremely pale skin so finding products that match my skin tone is almost impossible. To make matters worse, I have very oily combo skin. Every other concealer that I have ever tried has been not quite the right color, transfers like crazy, creases really badly, accentuates my dry patches, and practically slides off of my face. I had been wanting to try this concealer for a while, because I absolutely love the Pro Filt’r foundation and  I’m so glad that I finally gave it a shot. This concealer almost doesn’t even have to be set. If my skin was slightly less oily I would have no problems with not setting it. Setting powder has become almost like a security blanket instead of a necessity. This concealer doesn’t budge. \n\nI love that it complements my foundation so well. I wear shade 100 in the Pro Filt’r foundation, and shade 100 compliments it beautifully. The concealer isn’t much lighter (which I love because if it was any lighter I would look like a ghost) but the undertone is slightly more pink in the concealer vs the more yellow undertone in the foundation, which I also love because it balances out my mixed undertones nicely. \n\nI would 100% recommend this to anyone who has problems (1) finding a concealer that works with their skin tone and (2) won’t budge, crease, transfer, or slide off all day long.",

No creasing, not cakey. I’ve worn it all the day in really hot and humid days and It stays for hours on my skin even if I sweat!\nI have normal skin, but here in Spain the summer is intense and my skin gets super oily. \n\nI really recommend buying the concealer and the foundation of the line, they look BOMB together. Definitely the best foundation-concealer duo. \n\nI prefer applying them with a Beauty Blender rather than brushes, fingers or anything.\n\nI also suggest going to a store and ask a Sephora girl to find your perfect shades.\n\nJust BEAUTIFUL!",

I have to say that it honestly lasts longer than the Nars Radiant Creamy concealer (in Amande). Wow. I use this with tinted moisturizer, and I'm good for the day. I need to get the powder as well. I am so happy with this concealer. It literally matches my skin tone, like my entire face. I may get a different color to highlight underneath my eyes, but this concealer matches my forehead, cheeks, chin, etc. BUY THIS! If you have any doubts, just try it on in the store. Again, it lasts all day! This with either powder or setting spray, it really does stay on! It's light and the wand gives you a ton of concealer (like the Colourpop one)! I love mine forever!",

Another thing I love about this is that it is so buildable.  Lots of other concealers that have a cult following and that I like to use too like Tarte Shape Tape tend to be a little on the heavy side and I actually enjoy in the consistency of the Fenty because you can use it heavier and lighter depending on what you're trying to conceal or highlight.",

But, I really struggled to get it to work for me.\n\nFirst, it didn't really cover much. If you have perfect skin with zero blemishes, it will offer some coverage. Pimples? Nope. Dark circles? Barely. Redness? Kind of...but meh. Sometimes, it almost made the bumpy pimples worse. Not only did it fail to cover the pimple, it clung oddly to any bits of dry skin around the blemish to make it stand out more!\n\nSecond, sometimes it appeared to TAKE OFF MY FOUNDATION. I would use the wand to dab a bit on a blemish, use a blending sponge to blend, and there would be this spot that looked like I had taken makeup remover to it. What?! I finally figured I had to spray the blending sponge with setting spray, wipe the concealer on the sponge, and then blend it out, but it still took foundation off and left a makeup-less streak on my face. Is it something with the wand? I have no clue. But if you don't apply it just right, your face is going to look strange.\n\nThis strange foundation removing concealer phenomenon occurred so frequently, I had to use an insane amount of product to \"fix\" the makeup-less splotches. \n\nThe formula is ultra-creamy, smells nice, and does last a long time if you can manage to apply it without making things worse, but I think that's all this concealer has going for it!",

It can be a little dry and at first it goes on almost a little ashy but then as you blend it out and it starts to warm to your skin, it starts to appear closer to how its discribed, which is warm. It does oxidize, just a little, which I hear her foundation does too. It gets about a half shade darker than it appears at first, which I actually don't mind, because then the ashiness disappears and its closer to the color I'd really like it to be (like if Pro'Filter came in 330.5 in addition to 330). All in all, would continue to buy. Just make sure if you have a dry under eye area, you really moisturize and prime. (would definitely use with a dewy or non-matte primer if you have dryness issues)",

This is it!!! The color is very good and brightens up enough for me not to look dead at work. I would say the description is spot on. It's on the matte side but still gives you the moisture you need so you don't crease as much or not at all. (I still crease a lil cause I have horrible under eye fine lines but this is the LEAST creasing I've ever experienced!) Plus cause of that Demi matte consistency you don't get the texture! It is buildable coverage a little goes a long way. The matching system for concealer from the foundation helps you get closer to the shade that will match you, highlight you or contour you very easily. Just a lil research from my foundation shade in the Fenty and the color swatch on the photos of the arms for the concealer led me to my perfect match in 235 for the concealer. I currently have 230 in the foundation which was my closest match but not exact I believe the 235 is one of  the newer shades added to the foundation that I think would be pretty spot on for me once I get a new bottle and the matching concealer I think would be awesome!",

It does a pretty good job with coverage because it layers easily. I like to apply my concealer and let it sit for about 3-5 min before I blend it out. I find it get the most coverage that way. I feel like it makes my under eye area look smoother than any other concealers I've used with minimal creasing.",

An associate at Sephora mentioned off hand that Fenty's concealer is comparable to that of NARS, so I decided to give it a try. My dark circles are extremely pigmented. They've got a little bit of a hollow and are practically purple/blue-ish. This concealer blends soooo nicely and  I don't need to layer as much as I used to with NARS. It is buildable however and applies so smoothly, and the coverage is incredible! I am so happy that I decided to try this one, I can't believe I'm making the switch over. Another thing that I love about this concealer is the applicator. It's flat on both sides which is ridiculously comfortable when I'm applying and it allows you to make use of the most amount of product each time.",

But I was willing to put in the extra time if the shade was going to look good all day.  Upon first application it looked flawless and had medium coverage.  But by the day of the day it looked god awful.  It broke up really bad on my forehead and cheeks which I have never had a problem with before and it looked really greasy, creasy, and just bad.

But for me, it is the “are you.. *dramatic inhale* wEaRInG MaKEuP?” scenario. Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty released the new Pro Filt’r Instant Retouch Concealer and I have nothing to fear.\n\nThis stuff is magical. The price point is very well placed for 8 ml as a luxury makeup brand. What’s better? The results. I do not wear any foundation and use this concealer to lighten up the highpoints of my face. This makes my skin look p e r f e c t. I prep with a water-based moisturizer and go right in. This is a dryer, matte, and a fast-drying formula, so I recommend doing one eye at a time. This formula is also extremely very high coverage, so I use a dot on either side of my eyes and blend in, as I have some fine lines under my eyes I don’t want a party in. Afterward, I highly recommend setting this with a powder, as it will not crease or budge for the, wait for it, e n t i r e day. \n\nI do not recommend this concealer for anyone with dry skin (this is why this concealer only gets a four out of five shining stars from me), as it is very dry, but would recommend the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer (but remember, this brand does test on animals as required by law). \n\nWrapping things up, I must say that I do not look like I am wearing makeup at all. My skin looks flawless and like every teenager's dream. It almost beckons me to say “Worship me, peasants!”.",

Now I didn’t use the primer, maybe that could be a factor, but I’ve never had a concealer that caked and set into the pores like this did and that’s with the setting powder. I found it too heavy. I’m thinking is product is better for drag queens who need that heavy coverage. Although I wanted a full coverage, it was too much. Did blend well and the shade was wonderful. However I cannot give it last 1 star due to its effects.",

HOWEVER, after watching a tutorial from Riri, I think it is all in the application. When first using this concealer, I was applying it straight to my face using the wand, but Rihanna demonstrates that putting it onto the back of your hand to initially warm up the product, apply with fingers and then blend it out with a damp beauty blender or brush. That technique today made ALL the difference! Instead of a creasy mess, it was a flawless finish and I am absolutely willing to give this product a second chance.",

It conceals my undereyes without drying them out AND covers my blemishes beautifully without wearing off during the day. Before, I used to have to buy two different concealers for each purpose, but this one is now my ultimate favorite for both. A few tips, this does crease on me if I don't immediately bake with a non-drying setting powder (as an aside, I did not like Fenty's powder at all because it was so drying), so I think \"crease-proof\" is not an accurate way to describe this concealer. If I do set it though, it does stay creaseless all day. Also, the colors are purposely different than the corresponding foundations, so be sure to take the time to find a color that suits you. (I am 180 in the foundation, but 180 in the concealer is way too yellow for me. I use 210 for general concealing and 270 to color correct under my eyes.)",

The good thing I found about this concealer is the coverage and it’s also easy to blend, but that’s where the good things stop unfortunately. I have very oily skin, but when i use this concealer my skin looks dry dry dry!! I used this concealer and tried different blending methods, a sponge, my fingers, a brush, but every attempt the same result. The days I wore this concealer my friends commented on how cakey my face looked, and every time when I would get home and look in the mirror, my skin looked so horrible, it was cracking and looked super dry, even though my face was still greasy?? Yeah, I wouldn’t recommend this concealer. Maybe you need to use a super super hydrating primer or moisturizer underneath it, but it’s just not working for me.

Having now worn it for the first time for 8  hours today, I have to say it has held up much better in places where I only needed a tiny bit. Trying to cover the entire undereye area was tragic. I moisturized well but still by the time I left for work 30 mins later, it was already creasing and settling into fine lines. So I definitely won't use it that way again. The tiny places where I dotted it on to cover a red mark, etc. still look good. All in all, 4 out of 5 stars, and don't choose a shade based on online swatches. If possible find a way to sample it in person.",

        "review_text": "So I've been playing with this product for a month or so and I'm conflicted. I use it with the corresponding foundation from Fenty and it's been very finicky to use on my skin (mid-30s, combo skin). The foundation has been great, it is the only one I know of that doesn't fully breakdown on my nose by the end of the day. I've used other concealers and it's been fine. This one there it literally ONE way that it works on me. Moderate amount of moisturizer, NO primer, and then the concealer works fine. Not super high coverage but it looks nice. If I use too much moisturizer, or my normally awesome Tatcha primer, or if I mix in a bit of oil with the foundation, or anything to make it just a little less matt and drying on my *getting older* skin, when I apply the concealer it strips the foundation off as soon as I try to blend it in. Doesn't matter if I use a beauty blender or my finders. Doesn't matter if I wait for the foundation to dry, doesn't matter if I let the concealer sit for a few minutes, it will strip off the foundation fully. And you can't fix it. There's no putting more foundation or concealer on to try to get the coverage back, you'll just make it worse. I can go in and use Tarte concealer after to fix it, but then why use this at all? \n\nBut if I'm having a light makeup day and I just put a bit of the concealer on to spot conceal it works well and lasts a long time. It just this with the Fenty foundation will not tolerate any added moisture or oil to the situation. I've even used it with Becca full coverage foundation and my wet and wild and not had this problem. I really wanted to like this more and I'll keep it around for those light days, but it's definitely not going to be my go-to.",

About the product: it is nice and creamy, but you really need to blend or pat it in quickly. It sort of dries down. I understand this would be perfect for oily skin, so I accepted that, even though I’m a dry person. But the coverage is superb. Even tho it does dry down, it doesn’t get all crepey, and settle into my wrinkles. Maybe I’m just getting used to the texture. I used one of Fenty matchsticks before, and liked it a lot, but this really has staying power. It’s reasonably priced, too, for the tiny amount I use. I’m a fan!",

I appreciate that I can wear this with other foundations especially since the foundation isn’t my go to. I alternate matchstix and the concealer for my contour and it works just as well!

The only thing about that concealer is while there is full coverage, something about the undertone and the way that my powder stuck to it made it dry and cracky. Honestly I didn’t expect much from this concealer because I read it was light-medium coverage. If it can cover my dark circles better than other concealers that claim to be full coverage, it will for sure cover yours. Powder goes on top of this extremely nicely and it doesn’t crease all day long. I definitely found my new favorite concealer that I don’t think I’ll stop using!

I can use this by itself without the foundation and looks flawless! I do wish that I would have gotten a couple shades lighter to go with the foundation. It still looks nice with the foundation but if you want to look brighter I would go a couple shades down. The formula is very creamy and blends well but does crease a little even when I do put powder on. I didn't use the Fenty powder so maybe that will help with the creasing?

I slap on 3-5 dots and blend with my finger, and haven't had to set it yet this winter. During the day, I tend to get a little oily under the eyes, but even without setting, this doesn't move much, crease, or smudge my mascara. Someone with drier undereyes might need a little face oil, or maybe skip setting altogether, since it sorta self sets. I got my exact (foundation) shade, because 320 is a little pinkish, which brightens my dark circles/spots, and keeps my routine simple.",

Avoid any other dry spots, this will cling to it, making it look drier and cracky. \nSo my advice to you is.. make sure to have a nice moisturized face.  Do not wear a matte foundation, this concealer will help to mattify your foundation, especially if you use this concealer to highlight.",

So when I heard about the concealer launching I couldn't WAIT to buy because typically I just go with a concealer and a loose powder a la Violettefr. :) The shade range is EVERYTHING, it stays put without looking textured or cakey...seems like it will work so well in the summer months as well due to it being humidity resistant. I've been using it with the Fenty loose powder in Butter over top and it's looking great!",

If you have light-medium skin, choose 180. Hope this will be helpfull to pick the good color. (180 is very close to vanilla multi use concealer by too faced).",

First of all, although there are 50 shades, the light to medium with warm skin tone seemed like mustard color when applied on my skin. sonI had to go with nuteral undertone and hope for a miracle. \nThen when I tried it for the first time like I would normally do with my Holly Grail (Nars)- I would leave it on a bit before blending so it gives a better coverage with little product on and doesn't look thick or creasy. So I tried the same with this one but it just dried too fast and became very difficult to blend leaving a harsh line under my eye if you know what I'm saying. so I had to try again blending it faster but it just got patchy with not enough coverage and my dark circles were peeking through that I had to add a tiny dot and here it really turned into a hot mess.. to get it to look decent, I had to use extra under eye moisturizer then I needed to color correct with a warmer shade from my Nars first then go with this one to get it to properly cover but again, the texture was not flattering at all and too drying.. Maybe I was doing it wrong or maybe it's meant for oily under eyes? guess I'll never know",

I matched the concealer shade to my foundation shade (the same number) and find that they go perfectly together. I have also purchased the \"brightening\" corresponding shade for my tone (as provided on Fenty's chart which was super helpful) and it goes perfectly. The applicator and packaging are both stunning and feel very luxurious to use! This concealer goes a long way: build up in layers instead of applying a lot at first! It goes on heavy if you do. \n\nThe only thing that people may have a problem with is that I have found that this creases easily, however I don't mind a few creases.

Just wish they had been simple about the shade numbers. Like, if you're 300 in foundation the concealer must be the exact shade hence its 300 concealer label (not one or two shades up or down). know what i mean? lol \n\nanyone know what concealer is the exact shade match to 300?? lol \n\nIts an amazing formula, its dewy and glow-y!",

I will finish using it as I do like that it blends well but I won't repurchase.",

I use 360 in the foundation, so I wanted to follow Rihanna's instruction and get the concealer that is also 360.  This makes it soooo much easier than trying to swatch through the other 49 colors.  Initially I was concerned that the color was too close to my foundation color, but honestly I think there haven't been enough concealers on the market that match close enough to a foundation that actually matches my complexion. For years, I've been using concealers that are way too light because that's all that's been available.  This concealer has a great formula and blends in well with the foundation.  I would recommend that you get the shade that is paired with your foundation.  It's not drying (so far) and I have not experienced creasing, though I didn't wear it for long (just long enough to try it on with the foundation).  The applicator is nice and the coverage is good.  Highly recommend.",

I previously used the Nars Creamy Concealer and Tarte Shape Tape but this Fenty one is even better. I use it under my eyes, on my nose to brighten, and for blemishes. I tried the same color as my Fenty foundation and it matches perfectly. The consistency is creamy and it stays on pretty well. It still creases a little, but I have yet to find a concealer that doesn't crease at all!",

So, I was scared to change brands because I was very happy prior to trying this. BUT I will say, obviously the shade range is awesome with Fenty. I was able to find the lighter shade I wanted with the right undertone. So far I am in love and do not know if I will switch back! Highly recommend. Goes on smooth and doesn't dry too fast, which makes for perfect blending!!!!",

It covers my mild redness and acne scars perfectly. I have the fenty 180 foundation as well and the concealer is a seamless match. It does crease little bit under the eyes, but I have found that you can fix this by waiting ten or fifteen minutes after application and then just blending out the creases. Setting spray helps as well.",

I love that Fenty has created corresponding shades to the foundation because it makes it easier to shop and adjust the colour without too much work. I know a lot of people want a brighter highlight, but I am so over that and does Rihanna really doesn't have an overly highlighted face, nope. Rihanna is all about a natural fresh look and she did that with her concealer. The concealer gives a nice subtle highlight to the face. It blends out easier and doesn't dry too quickly. The applicator gets a lot of product so you don't need to dip back into the tube. The formula is creamy and a little thick but it makes the skin look perfect. It also stays in places and does not move at all. I have combination to oily skin and my tzone is the oiliest so the concealer does break down on my nose but does not move.",

So I would keep that in mind if you think to just get the same #, I wear #150 and I would say I should have gotten #170.   I have dry skin so I use a very hydrating eye cream but even with that I found it made my undereyes looked older and excentuated any dryness.

I tried plenty of different ways to try to prevent it from happening (e.g., Beaty blender, RT sponge, concealer brush, foundation brush, lightly powdering, baking, reapplying concealer to lifted areas, different foundation/primer combos) but to no avail. \n\nThe only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the shade range. But even tho it’s worked for other people, it’s gonna be a no for me dawg☠️",

I use 150 in the foundation as well and the concealer seems to be a slight bit brighter than the foundation, which I LOVE because makes your skin look naturally highlighted in the right places. The formula has a hydrating whipped texture, while still drying down matte. \nI do not currently use this concealer with the fenty powder but it is something I am wanting to try! With my other powder, I do see slight creasing at the end of the day, but its nothing that bothers me.",

However this is amazing as an eyeshadow primer it doesn't crease. The major draw back for me is the shade choice i will have to disagree with Fenty aka RIRI sorry boo but the shade 235 does not compliment the foundation 235. This shade is describe as for medium skin with warm undertones. When I swatched the foundation next to the concealer i notice it is way darker than the foundation. That is a big no no for me plus the undertone of the concealer is not warm at all it is more of a neutral shade. Even the picture on the box displays the undertone. I purchase this online and I will be returning tomorrow for another color just because this does not crease. This is a good base to add another concealer. I tested this out by adding the two faced multi sculpting concealer on top just a dap and it didnt crease all day. Overall the formula is great we just need more coverage and accurate undertones for the matching foundation number. I know this was a lot to read but I really hope this helps someone think twice before purchasing online.",

I am a perfect 300 match for her foundation and at first got the concealer in 260, (I love a highlighted look). 260 blended right into the foundation as if i had gotten the perfect match, so I exchanged it for 280, which was actually lighter because of the undertone when compared to 260. It was a tiny bit, the smallest amount of brighter but after drying down and setting it, it seemed exactly like 260 and the foundation. I finally went back and exchanged it for the concealer in 160 and thank god this one worked. I was scared that it was going to be too white/ light because it's in the 100 range and I am 300 in the foundation, but actually, it was more than perfect. \nMoving on to the consistency, when I first tried this concealer out I did not like it. I am only 20 years old but at the time I was using an eye serum that gave me visible lines ad this concealer sank right into it and setting it made it worst. I removed the eye serum from my routine and my under eyes returned to normal (specifically that one very visible wrinkle disappeared) and the concealer applied perfectly. It blends in like a dream. That being said this concealer might not work for mature under eyes or you can make it work but you definitely have to be more careful with it. I am used to using the Shape tape but wanted something just as pigmented but more hydrating. I use the colors light-medium (for a highlighted look) and medium (for a perfect match or no foundation day) in the shape tape for reference.",

I'm light/medium and fairly neutral but with some yellow tones, and everything I've ever found has been the right tone but not the right shade or level or whatever. Too pink or too gray or too ashy or too dark, you get it. Not this one. Shade 185 disappears into my skin without foundation. It also does an amazing job concealing my super intense dark circles. It's full coverage, so I can dab it where I want and then buff it out, meaning that I can do the \"no makeup\" thing but still cover a zit or redness if I want to. \n\nI've tried a million concealers, including two of the $80 Cle de Peau ones, and Rihanna's got them all beat.",

I don't have a shade in the foundation, but this is pretty amazing. \n\nTexture: creamy, semi-thick\nApplication: less is more, start light then build up\nBlendability: I recommend letting it dry down slightly before blending, as it tends to father slightly in fine lines when too wet; doesn't dry down super fast\nWear: Set this well and you'll be fine ALL DAY\n\nIF YOU SET WITH A COLORED POWDER... the concealer will change color. This shade works for me bc I use the Fenty powder in Honey, which makes it more yellow/neutral and a little darker. The more you let it dry, the less the color changes.",

I originally ordered 210, the same shade as my foundation, but bought 145 to brighten under my eyes. I should have tried it in the store instead of going online - 145 is a lil too light, but that's fine, I'll mix it with a dash of my 210 and it works. It's smooth, not too heavy, not too watery, it really is buildable, and it doesn't pull on my undereye area when I'm applying or blending. I've used the applicator, a concealer brush, and a mini beauty blender with it and they're all great. I do have to be careful with the thin skin under my eyes - I'm 43 and things can get real cakey real easily but this does NOT. I've set it using the new Fenty setting powder and most recently I baked it with the Too Faced Peach setting powder for a different effect and I love it either way! Love the color range. Basically this concealer is getting me back into concealers when I'd kind of given up on them for the last 20 years, no lie. Bless you Rihanna! You have changed my makeup GAME.",

It DOES take some work to blend into your skin because it is thicker than your average concealer. But once it's on, it stay solid for the whole day! I've tried it as an eye primer as well, and it does a good job, just give it enough time to dry first. You also need the TINIEST amount, so a little goes a long way.

However, what I heard and watched was not what came through for me.\nPros: the concealer matched my skin tone beautifully and sat underneath the eyes well. Doesn't budge much either. \nCons: this product sunk SO DEEPLY into my smile lines around my lips I was SHOOK. I've never had a product do that before, so I was very disappointed after noticing them a few hours into the wear. It's also not a longwear concealer. \nOverall, don't expect much from this product. Good for in the moment, but just not for people like me who don't like reapplying makeup throughout the day.",

I don't have dry under eyes, but this concealer would crease like CRAZY and settle into my skin and just make any imperfection so much more noticeable.  I tried applying it several different ways (precision sponge, brush, finger, letting it set then blend, blending right away) and the result was always the same.\n\nI gave it two stars because I find it did cover up my dark spots, but I prefer the coverage of Nars Radiant over this product.  The applicator is fantastic, you really can apply as little or as much as you want.  The other thing I liked is that your Fenty foundation number does correlate with the concealer.

For spot concealing I use shade 445 under the foundation and it covers beautifully. Similar to the foundation this concealer will give you medium buildable coverage.",

        "review_text": "So sad that this was a miss for me. I’m a huge fan of the foundation so I had high hopes for the concealer. The coverage is definitely more of a medium coverage than full. The concealer feels thick so I thought it would cover more. Since it is thicker/tackier it takes some working with a damp beauty blender to get it blended in. I first tried it set with my Tarte shape tape setting powder. This didn’t work out. My concealer looked shadowed, like my circles were showing through. And it was cracking apart under my eyes, which I had prepped like usual with eye cream prior to makeup application. Day 2 I tried it prepped with eye cream and then set with my Laura Mercier translucent. The concealer didn’t crack this time but my under eyes looked so dry and cakey and textured I’m not sure that was an improvement. This unfortunately is going back :(",

This is not something I would wear when people are going to be close up just because it really is super matte and can easily look very dry. It does crease and creates lines I’ve never seen before when using any other foundation and concealer. However, with that being said, the creasing was not that bad for me. The creasing is minimal and noticeable only when really close. A little goes a long way with this concealer. It is thick but it’s also creamy of a consistency. There are pros and cons - it more so depends what you are looking for. I would not recommend for dry skin at all unless you really moisturize and prep beforehand",

It looks smooth, and I would say it has a medium-full coverage (it doesn’t look like stark full coverage paint upon first application, but you can layer it a little for more coverage). For reference, I don’t like shape tape (too full coverage and dries too quickly for me) but I do really like the Too Faced Born This Way concealer.\n\nThe shades do dry down darker than they look while wet, but I don’t find that they continue getting darker through the day, the color reaches its darkest after a few mins.

I've tried different application techniques. I've tried letting it sit under my eyes after blending it out, and then coming back to blend out the creases and then set. Nada. I've paired it with the setting powder (BOMBBBBBB.com). My next plan is to try it with another setting powder, and also try the powder with different concealers to get a better understanding of what the products are like. I'm not kidding.... if Fenty stepped it up a notch in coverage and were able to make this truly crease proof - it would be a game changer for us dry skin girls! If you can handle the creasing, please please please try it. I plan to experiment more to find out if I can make this the concealer of my dreams.",

I made it a point not to put any setting powder because 1 the formula is already a bit matte(but not drying) and 2 I wanted to see how it lasts throughout the day. It held on strong!! A few little touch ups throughout the day with my finger but it wasn’t melting off at all unlike other concealers that i have tried. I would recommend it for ppl who have dark circles like me. It’s buildable and blends really well with the skin. I attached my morning photo and evening photo so you can see that after a long day at work it only came off slightly. Hope this helps! Enjoy",

I've been setting it w my Huda baking powder and it looks very smooth under the eye.

But where I LOVE LOVE this concealer and I was not expecting is with a no makeup look. Just moisturizer and alittle of this under the eye- WOW it just melted into the skin giving the no makeup beautiful look. It looked like I was wearing nothing, u couldn’t see where the concealer ended and my skin started. Perfect if you don’t do a lot of makeup or something quick to run errands. I’m a huge makeup person but on my days off I’ll just throw on alittle of this to go out shopping. I will say the online swatches are deceiving. I went to the store and played around to find the perfect color. Would definitely purchase again especially when those hot summer months come around",

Not the exact same color, but a little lighter to highlight. I absolutely love this concealer. I love the formula, it blends in so smoothly and a little goes a long way. The applicator is awesome. Again, Fenty Beauty can do no wrong by me. Adding this to my list of faves!",

I have hooded lids and naturally puffy under eyes so I have these little folds that pretty much collect product but I didn’t have to worry about that at all with this concealer. I bought the 310 shade to wear with 345 in the foundation and it’s a really nice bright highlight. I’m definitely going to get another shade for hyperpigmentation and spot concealing.",

First off, I don’t agree with the marketing that the concealer shade corresponds with your foundation shade. I’m 240 in the foundation and I bought 240 in the concealer and it was way too bright for my under eyes. I know some people prefer that highlighted look but it’s def not something I like on an everyday basis. Secondly, the product’s consistency is a bit thick, which I thought would result in super full coverage such as Tarte Shape Tape concealer but like... the coverage wasn’t there so that was confusing. I tried it with both brush and beauty blender and I found myself having to apply more and more product to get the coverage I like and then by that point, it made my undereyes and other areas so dry and creasy. Also: Dry skin people beware, it most definitely clings to dry patches if you have any.",

Package nice it is same as the foundation just smaller. Application is slightly flatter then other concealers which helps get in all the smaller areas more easy.

I have yet to find my perfect foundation match for Fenty beauty so I went with the description of the colours instead. First of all I love the doe foot applicator, it's nice and flat which allows it to carry more product and spread more nicely. I actually don't have to dip several times into the concealer when I'm applying it. The formula is very creamy but not too creamy. it blends into the skin so easily! I actually look forward to applying my concealer. I have no creasing at the end of the day and it stays put all day! Hopefully I can find my foundation match soon. I definately recommend this concealer. The price is also decent. I've been using it everyday since I bought it!",

I hear a lot that many brands do not offer full spectrum of foundation/concealer for darker skin, and not too many mention that most of the lighter offerings are mostly for yellow based tones. Unless one is extremely pale, pink based light shades are also difficult to find. This brand is definitely covering variety of skin tones. I am also happy that I didn’t have any allergic reaction the way I often do. It didn’t completely cover my dark circles, but nothing really does unless it’s stage makeup. It made my dark circles significantly less noticeable and didn’t look like I was wearing makeup. It’s another huge plus in my books.",

I am 310 in the foundation and I decided to pick the same color in this product. Am glad I did because 310 in this concealer is much lighter then the actually foundation!!!

I found with this concealer use a tiny bit and build up and I've used the banana shade to set my whole face. The cashew powder was too dark for me and the butter was too light but surprisingly the banana was good for my whole face. It's very creamy almost reminds of the shape tape but not drying or cakey. I think the shades oxidizes, i think even the powders too. Also it's not too heavy to wear alone without foundation. I don't have time somedays after getting my daughter on the bus and than to get to work i just use concealer set it and it doesn't look weird",

I decided to do a wear test, worked out, and by the time I came back to Sephora that same day I asked the employees to pick the side that looks better and every Sephora employee picked the side that had Nars because the Fenty side looked so greasy and oily. Fenty was literally sitting on top of my skin. Mind you I did not set either concealer but Nars performed better than Fenty did. Needless to say I returned it. It creased under my eyes, and it definitely was not sweat proof. I wanted to love it but I could not support that especially if I already have a Nars concealer that does better than Fenty.",

Maybe if I bake the powder will set better? \n\nOverall, when I finally got the concealer to work, it was beautiful and long lasting when set with my Pretty Vulgar translucent powder.

It looked okay under my eyes but quickly settled into my fine lines. When I applied the concealer to other parts of my face, it was impossible to blend out and the concealer was totally visible. Once I blended it the best that I could, I used the Fenty setting powder and finished my makeup. I wore my makeup for 8 hours at work I felt like there was frosting on my face from how thick it was. This made my skin oily and I haven’t had oily skin in at least a year. None of my other concealers do any of this, so I’ll be sending this one back.",

It sunk into my undereye lines very quickly and it makes it look like I have more than I do, I'm 14. Everybody’s skin is different, and this didn’t work for me.",

I thought that tarte shape tape was a game changer but this stuff is 100% better and a step up from shape tape. The biggest thing is the feel of this stuff, goes on so creamy and almost comfortably hydrating yet still gives coverage without any heaviness.

Also maybe because it was dry it looked terrible under my eyes and made lines stand out that I didn't know I had. I had a hard time trying to match my skin tone as well; either too light or too dark. I have a very yellow undertone and despite the many shades available this line didn't have a shade that worked well for me.

I must say this is hands down one of the best concealers I’ve used, very comparable to the tarte shape tape but much lighter and creamier in texture but still allowing it to be a nice medium to full coverage, while looking a lot less drying under the eyes! Now shade range is absolutely amazing! It’s the first time I’ve ever been able to match myself perfectly to a concealer that I actually like and works for me! I went with the shade 145 originally planning to go with 130 but the undertone didn’t correspond to the description in my option! Also I didn’t see many olive warm undertones in the medium shades, I found they all ran abit pink and peachy! Besides that I must say give this a shot!",

It’s super creamy, a little goes a long way, and for this matched color to my foundation, it surprisingly wasn’t that much lighter, which I kind of liked, but i might go a shade lighter on my next purchase. My only complaint (and it’s not that big of one for me) is that it did instantly sink into my creases, however almost every single concealer I have ever tried has done that with these tiny fine lines under my eyes. I did enjoy the medium coverage over my dark circles under my eye and the way it blended on my t-zone and chin. I will also say my concern is that for dry skin, it does still get a little flaky, but again for me personally it doesn’t bother me too much because I think I need to up my moisturizer more.

The concealer is a few shades lighter than your foundation, which I love for brightening under the eyes. The formula is very creamy, similar to Nars Radiant Creamy concealer. The applicator is a flat one, so it's easy to swipe on where you need it and get in small spaces. It is a more wet concealer, so if you want it to be fuller coverage, let it dry for a couple minutes before blending it out with a sponge. I do not bake, it looks too heavy under my eyes, but I set with just the smallest amount of translucent powder (I use Lancome and it is incredible!), And I am good all day.  It does crease a tiny bit but what concealer doesn't? Just pat out the tiny line and go on with your day. The coverage is pretty good, I have very dark circles under my eyes so I need a second coat in some areas, but as long as you don't have crypt keeper under eyes like me then you will be fine and covered up with one layer. So happy Fenty always comes out with SO. MANY. SHADES. Every single time! So everyone can enjoy her products. Love this concealer and would recommend it to anyone.",

She did not come to play. She came to slay. Ms. Fenty is going to leave us bald if she keeps snatching our wigs an edges. This is creamy and sets down well. Not drying but not too emollient either.. If you like Nars Radiant Creamy, think that, but a little thicker. Because ya girl is thicc, but not super creasy like a lot of her competitors. Just go buy it. If your here in the reviews you're probably looking for a reason to get it. Well here it is, I'm telling you. BUY IT SIS!",

When I apply and blend out with the sponge it’s somewhat sticky, not a lot but enough for me to notice a difference. The coverage is good tho.

Color wise, they both served their purpose. \n\nAs for the negatives: I was not a fan of the applicator, I found it to be too flimsy (for reference, I currently use Too Faced Born this Way Concealer, which has a sturdy applicator). I found it difficult to work with. \n\nThe product itself I found to be patchy, and difficult to blend out (using a beauty blender). After I managed to blend it out, I found it to crease quite significantly after setting. This was even more confusing, as I used this with the Fenty Beauty Foundation. \n\nI was hoping that throughout the course of the day, it would look better, but unfortunately it looked worse at the day went on. I decided to return the product. \n\nI gave this 2 stars, because the color selection was quite great, and it didn't break me out, which signifies that it could work well with sensitive skin. Otherwise, I would say this product is a miss.",

I used the same primer and foundation I usually use. Then I used it by itself without primer, same deal. My makeup revolution concealer does a way better job of covering and spreading and not creasing. I was so dang disappointed. I spent my hard earned money on this product - I’m not new to makeup, I have at tried at least 20 different concealers in the last 6 months. I can not recommend this product.

I’ve been using Born This Way In Mocha in which I also love but at times I hate wearing it when I just want to have a basic makeup day without doing the most. I decided to get the Fenty concealer that matches it, which was in my opinion 385. I wear 420 foundation and didn’t get the concealer in 420 because I love for my concealer to highlight and pop vs being very subtle. But if you want just a really natural not so much of a highlight look then the concealer that is matched with your foundation should be fine. First and foremost a little goes a long way. It is very smooth and creamy so it spreads easily. The coverage is light and gave really good coverage. I wore a full face of Fenty products with inclusion of the newest products and the concealer lasted the entire day to night( I did use the setting powder in Cashew for my under eye and t zone as well). I had no creases and really no issue at all. I’ve come to realize that with Fenty foundation, concealer, and etc combined the brand is putting emphasis on achieving a natural flawless look that looks like you have no makeup on at all. Which is perfect for someone that wants to wear makeup everyday and doesn’t want to look over done and just absolutely NATURAL. I suggest having someone color match you perfectly so when the products are applied your face will look flawless and feel like it’s your skin.",

When I swatched it in store I liked how it felt and decided to buy it since I get a better idea of how concealers work once they’re on my face and set. The way it glides on I can’t even explain! Definitely different when you swatch on your hand vs on the face. It’s like a gel/mousse whipped kind of consistency and I believe that’s what makes it crease proof or resistant (if you have natural creases/lines they’ll most likely always come through sad reality). It didn’t dry my under eyes and set so beautifully. Instant holy grail! Side note: I bought the shade that correlates with my foundation shade. I don’t like too much brightness under my eyes, just a bit so I got the recommended color (240).",

The first time I used it, the powder clung in all the wrong places and the concealer started to separate close to my eye. The second time I applied it, I spent more time blending out the concealer (and used way less powder to avoid patchiness). The concealer looks really nice at first, but it creases very quickly. Once I blended out the creases,  I used the setting powder and it just made it look dull and dried out/ textured. \n\nNot even 4 hours later, the concealer has completely separated from the foundation. I have never seen my under eye look so bad before. Normally I’d assume it was maybe the concealer and setting powder not working well together.. but shouldn’t these products be made for each other? If a product doesn’t work for me the first time, I usually try it out a few more times to be sure. This one only needed to be used twice to realize this just doesn’t work for me. Really bummed I have to return.",

I wanted something that was closer to my skintone (as opposed to lighter/brightening) for a more natural look.  I easily found a shade that worked, applied it in the store using my fingers, set it with my go-to powder and headed off to work.  Nine hours later, it was still in place and doing its job. I haven’t tried it for blemishes, but as an under-eye concealer, I would definitely recommend. For those who have naturally dry under eyes like mine, don’t be scared off.  If you’re moisturizing the area nightly, you should be fine.",

I have tried many brands (tarte shape tape, Kay von d, urban decay, cover girl, etc.) both drug store and high end and this is the only one I truly love on the first wear.\nIt’s very creamy and glides on easily, blends seamlessly and stays put with setting powder (I also purchased her new translucent powder the same day I bought this).\nIt’s so pigmented and a little goes a very long way. I dotted it on the places needed (I have cystic acne and deep brown and red scars on my T-zones) and they vanished.\nThe formula is amazing, it smells beautiful, but not fragranced too much, for I also have sensitive skin. The applicator itself is long and is drenched in product so you have no need to repeatedly dunk it back in the bottle to obtain more.\nI wore my makeup for almost 9 hours and it didn’t crease under my eyes or fade from where I put it. \nThe packaging is exactly like her foundation, glass bottle, plastic white cap, easy-to-use pump. It’s luxurious and sturdy, which I appreciate so much for the price.\nIt doesn’t cake, which is a problem I repeatedly had with other concealers from different brands. It’s not oily feeling, just light weight and feathery. \n10/10 would recommend to any and everyone, amazing product!",

I’ve never found a concealer with that perfect peachy undertone. I’ll actually be able to use it without foundation on days that I’m too lazy. I wouldn’t say I have dark circles but I get that sallow look, especially around my eyes, and this brightened it just the right amount without looking too bright. A touch of the butter loose powder was the perfect finishing touch to set. I also like the texture more than shape tape, it’s somehow thicker/creamier and yet less drying.",

I have tried a lot of concealers and many different methods of applying them, and I only have a handful that I love and I can say, this concealer does everything I want a concealer to do. I don’t need a ton of coverage, so I can’t speak on that. However, I usually layer my maybelline fit me or nars radiant creamy to get a desired coverage in certain areas and I didn’t really have to do that with this one. One thing I’m also picky about is blendability. The shape tape from Tarte failed for me because it was drying and wouldn’t blend, but this one blends seamlessly and doesn’t look dry and cakey like Tarte shape tape and many others do. The shade range is also very impressive with this since there are 50 shades. You can guarantee you will find a match for you. I love the packaging, the applicator, and that it doesn’t burn my eyes like my maybelline fit me has started to do, even though I loved its formula. I can’t recommend this concealer enough. I also recommend getting one of the setting powders as well because it also worked well for me!",

I’ve been wearing it ever since I got it today for about 8  hours and it has not creased and it looks absolutely so flawless. The powder is amazing and smells very light and fresh but also really locks in your make up without looking cakey and powdery this is my new favorite duo I can’t wait to wear it more. The powder also does not have flashback.

However it looks like skin! These shades seem to aim to be the kind of concealers that aim to look more natural than brightening or highlighting. So keep that in mind when picking. For my oily girls, it's matte matte matte! Reminds me of a higher quality version of Colourpop (As far as finish and dry time). I want to buy one for contouring, now that i know what the finish is like. With 50 shades, no wonder i was able to find a match with one go.",

Tried it out versus the Nars and I must say that they are exactly the same type of creamy texture, except the Fenty one is way smoother and easier to blend. A little definitely goes a long way for this product, so make sure you are blending it out if you use a full dip and swipe. It does not feel heavy and it doesn’t easily crease, even after wearing it for 2 hours. It is a bit pricey but you do get plenty of product in the package and how much the applicator picks up.",

        "review_text": "I've been on the hunt for a concealer that rivals Shape Tape as I want to support more inclusive brands (especially after their foundation launch ... yikes), but unfortunately nothing has come close. Until this. \n\nI'm normally 140 in the Pro Filt'r foundation, and I was a bit skeptical of how this shade in the concealer would work for me. It's marketed as a shade with \"cool pink undertones\", and I was worried this would pull too cool/pink on my neutral skin. However, this is almost an exact shade match to my Shape Tape shade, fair neutral (albeit a slight bit darker, but it's barely noticeable). It doesn't pull pink on application, and is light enough for me to use both as an undereye concealer and to carve out my brows. \n\nAs for the formula, I don't have anything like this in my collection right now. I'd say it's a cross between Shape Tape and FAB's avocado concealer. It has a medium to full-coverage finish, depending on how much you use. For me, I can cover my undereyes with about 3-4 swipes and the redness around my nose with a dot on each side. It gives me about the same coverage under my eyes as Shape Tape does, but is noticeably less dry. This didn't emphasize my fine lines at all, and it also didn't crease under my eyes. It blends seamlessly, and it doesn't dry down too fast so you have some time to blend it out. The only issue I had was a bit of creasing on my eyelids, so if you're planning to use this as a shadow primer, I'd say set it fast to prevent creasing.\n\nThis is also a thiccc formula. I wasn't expecting that at all, since the Pro Filt'r foundation is so liquidy. I also find that it's easy to overuse because it's so thick - today, I ended up using way too much around my nose. So keep that in mind.\n\nAll in all, I'm super happy with how this is performing so far. I do want to note that I have pretty clear skin, and can't comment on how this would work for someone with acne or dark spots. For me, this works beautifully. Highly recommend.",

It has a consistency similar to a primer and mattifies my skin. There's no white cast and it is pretty much invisible. Also, a lot of SPF products contain at least some form of alcohol and/or fragrance but there's none to be found in this. The one thing that lets it down is the silicones, and we're not talking a small amount, there is a lot in here! I find I can get away with using it one morning, but if I attempt again on the following day, my skin reacts by breaking out in small hives throughout the day. And if I attempt a third day, I start to see bumps appear, which is very likely a result of the silicones clogging my pores up. The only way I can use up what's left in the tube is by A) using very occasionally, or B) if I don't have the time to apply a primer after my sun block, this makes a good makeup base/sunblock 2 in 1. Either way I have to be sure to strictly limit my usage of it. The fact that it doesn't leave any sign of where it's been applied may sound like a good thing, but it actually makes it very tricky to know where it has and hasn't been applied. I end up using more than needed to try and ensure even coverage. And that in turn means more silicones clogging up my skin. Without them this would be a fantastic product. I really hope they bring out a silicone-free version of this someday.  \n\n~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~\n\n(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)\n\n1.

It also works as a primer. This sunscreen has a clear gel texture. It will disappear on your skin within 20 seconds and leaves no white cast, no greasy feeling at all.

It sits very nicely over almost any moisturizer and other products, and sits well under makeup as well (I usually use a primer over it, but probably not strictly necessary). The texture is very interesting and has a bit of a mattifying effect at first. After a few hours, I do notice it getting oily so I have to do some dabbing, but this is less extreme in cooler months and after getting used to it. Don't think I'd switch to anything else unless something amazing comes along. As an aside, I have microbladed eyebrows and I use it to protect the pigment in the sun/in general and it is fantastic for that purpose.",

I have acne-prone, sensitive, and oily skin and this doesn't cause me any clogging (with that being said, not all ingredients are for everybody, and patch testing is important if you're worried about breakouts!)\n\nPROS:\n-it has a very velvety texture, almost like a pore-filling primer\n-truly undetectable on the skin, which I loveeee\n-does not feel drying\n-virtually no scent (I loveee this as someone who 1) hates fragrance in skincare and 2) does not like the typical sunscreen scent)\n\nCONS:\n-This is not a sunscreen for makeup :/ I found that it separated under my concealers/foundations so it is not ideal for me, personally (hence the 4 stars)\n-There is Boswellia Serrata resin in here, which can be a sensitizing ingredient (even if it does have someee soothing benefits) and I did feel some stinging while applying....I'd rather they opt for a soothing ingredient without the potentiality for irritation, like allantoin or aloe\n-Very natural/matte finish, which is not necessarily a con, but I do like a dewy, hydrated look to the skin\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend for people who do not wear makeup a ton...just be careful if you are extremely sensitive to fragrance or essential oils, etc. because of that Frankincense :/",

As someone who is passionate about the science behind dermatology, and as a medical student training to be a future physician, I believe in a wellness-approach to skincare.

My naturally tan skin color loathed the ghost-like appearance that physical sunscreens gave me, and the fact that I never got sunburned further stroked my arrogance against applying sunscreen. \n\nIt was only as a 20-something medical student that I woke up one day realizing the gradual demise of my youth and purchased the 'unseen sunscreen' by supergoop that had forever been on my wishlist for its transparent formulation and UV protective properties. \n\nGoes on smoothly, completely unnoticeable once on. What more? Coats my skin like a primer and highlights the contours of my face in the most luxurious balmy way.\n\nI use it daily and have not had any bad reactions. I apply a chickpea-size amount to my whole face, neck, and ears.\n\nI do wish it was a bit cheaper as the tube runs out quickly if you use it as is recommended for sunscreens, which is the only reason I have deducted a star.",

I was only outside for about 40 minutes to maybe an hour. My arms and legs did not burn, but my face and neck definitely are burned.

This sunscreen really lives up to its name of being \"unseen\" because not only do I not see it once it's been applied, but I also don't feel it on my face. Basically, it doesn't feel \"heavy\" on my face like some sunscreens and moisturizers can. It's so lightweight that I have to look in the mirror while putting it on to make sure I don't miss any spots because it feels like I'm not putting anything on. What I will say is that it feels greasy as it's being applied, so I was worried it would make my face feel greasy. But thankfully it doesn't feel greasy once it's on. And a little goes a long way. You don't need to put too much on which is probably why the bottles aren't as big as usual facial sunscreen bottles are. I definitely recommend it!",

And I like that it's a relatively higher SPF in the world of face sunscreens. it's not terrible, but I don't think I'll be repurchasing and think it is incredibly overpriced. I think however that if you're someone with drier skin, the greasiness may actually be a plus, and the fact that it's a clear color is pretty great so bc of those things I'd still recommend it.

This doesn't make me break out at all , at most I get some clogged pores if I put it on multiple times a day in the hot summer. It goes on so soft and silky and leaves a really nice almost matte/natural look to my skin. I rarely wear make up so IDK how it works as a primer like it says. I took one star off because It isn't strong enough for after strong treatments like tretinoin, to being outside in the sun all day (I came in slightly pink) and also because the price went up and it's now stupidly expensive. I'm going to try La Roche Posay sunscreens as an alternative because of these two reasons. But if you have normal skin (no harsh treatments) and want a great looking sunscreen and don't mind the price, I do recommend this!",

She told me about Supergoop and I’ve been a devoted fan ever since. I love Unseen and Glow Screen. The texture and moisturizing action of Unseen is luxurious, and I swear it makes my 50-something neck look younger! It protects better than the heavy, pore clogging zincs. Thank you!",

Especially because this is so heavily promoted online. I was disappointed this felt very silicone-like and the best comparison I have is that it felt like a thinned out vaseline being spread over my skin. This did make me concerned this would make my skin irritated or cause breakouts as it feels very occlusive due to this texture, so I assumed it would act like a face oil. It also looked much greasier for a short while after applying, and I would not have kept this on my face and switched to another sunscreen if I was not going to apply a full face of makeup before going out.\nI was pleased that my concerns for my skin were not proven right - my face and neck were as happy as with my favorite formulas and no disruptions to the way the rest of my skincare or makeup sat on my skin all day as this worked very nicely under my makeup for the day. \nBut that being said because I was worried this would cause my face to feel too hot and suffocated, and while this is on the better end of what US sunscreens feel like on the face, I would not opt for this over either the glowscreen or any of the highly elegant and much more affordable Korean sunscreens that are now widely available.",

At first, I thought this sunscreen was too greasy. I have oily skin. However, I just recently realized that I haven’t been rubbing it in properly for the past several months! At least for me, it takes several minutes for it to absorb properly into my skin. If you’re having similar issues with the oiliness, try working it into your skin for several minutes. It’s personally helped me out so much! My only complaint is that this sunscreen is definitely pricey compared to others. However, I have found that it’s worth it to invest in a good sunscreen.

No smell, feels nice on the skin. Does its job. Nice matte finish and very easy on the skin :) Cons; cannot re-apply over makeup, makes my face cakey. I want to try the other products like the mist or brush to re-apply.\n\n\nDetailed review; I have combo skin and I am avid make-up user in Miami. I use a drunk elephant skin routine (Protini Polypeptide Cream, C-Firma Fresh Day Serum, B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum, Marula Oil) under this sunscreen primer and it works sooo well with the Lancôme Teint Idole Long Wear Foundation and Tarte Shape Tape concealer. I've also paired it with the Maybelline Fit Me foundation and works well, too! \n\nIt goes on LOVELY on the skin and is a great primer. It feels like a matte film that dissolves into the skin after a minute. My foundation also has sunscreen, it pairs well. Its been nice to wear with my make-up routine. The only con is, I cannot re-apply it over my make-up because it gives it a cakey texture. The cost is very high for me but after using it daily (pea size goes a long way!) it has been a great bang for my buck. I purchased it in March of 2022 and still have some in my bottle in October of 2022! I don't have to buy more for another month or so. No skin reaction at all! Nice matte finish. Buy it! :)",

This is the only sunscreen I've ever used that hasn't irritated my skin. It has a very unique texture (similar to the Benefit Porefessional) that is very blurring and smoothing, while still being soft and hydrating. It has great packaging and little to no scent (at least that I can smell). Supergoop knocked it out of the park for the sensitive skin folks on this one, and I hope they never reformulate.",

Unfortunately, this is also what I don't like about it. My skin feels uncomfortably dry after I put it on. It has a very weird texture, and after wearing it for a week straight I was quite disenchanted. On the plus side, like all Supergoop products, it is cruelty-free and reef-safe. I absolutely adore this brand and use a LOT of its products, but I won't buy this one again.",

If you’re using a pea size or even a finger strip, that’s primer, not sunscreen. \n\nMy two stars are because Trader Joe’s Daily Facial Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF40 has MORE sunscreen and the exact same inert ingredients—save one—in the exact same order. They’re producing it, selling at $9.00, and making a profit. That means that at $36 for this sunscreen we are all absolutely being had by this brand (and so many others). I’m over it. I’m over these brands making a killing off us trying to protect our skin from literal cancer. This isn’t some unique, highly inventive formulation that warrants anything near this price. There is now an exact copy for nearly every single Supergoop sunscreen for a fraction of the price and still we’re given a tag of nearly $40 for most. Forty. No. I’m done. You should be done too.",

I figured I’d give this a go because I work in a hot kitchen and don’t like to feel overly greasy at any point in the day but I also want to wear my sunscreen. This has been awesome, no pilling, no excess grease, and most important for me, no breakouts. I have super reactive skin and it goes red or I can get hives pretty easily so trying new products is a crapshoot most of the time. This sits well on my skincare below with no issue. I have others I’ll use if I’m out hiking or swimming but for everyday wear, this is the one. Ps I have olive skin tone",

This SPF feels like a primer, very silicon-like, and I love that texture personally but my skin would get oily 1-2hrs after applying which it hasn’t done in a long time (it’s usually 4-6 hrs or by the end of the day). Even if I used blotting paper or powder and re-apply, it would get oily so quickly again. I concluded that my skin needs more moisture from a sunscreen. I have combination skin where part of my face gets oily the other stays normal but can easily become dry. After days of using this I noticed that the texture changed slightly and the SPF became more gritty which I didn’t like since my skin is reactive + I didn’t like the feeling. Maybe I had a bad product, I’ll definitely try again in the future just in case but so far, I can’t recommend.",

Only reason I docked a star is because it did break me out a little bit, but I'm just sensitive to chemical sunscreen.",

HOWEVER, this particular product of theirs is terrible (IMO). It is definitely not suited for anyone with combo or oily skin. It is very slippery in texture (due to the oils, silicones & silica). I wore this inside my house and I’m glad I did. \n\nInitial application was just the sunscreen alone for about 15-20 mins. My skin had a slight sheen to it. I then proceeded with my normal makeup routine to see how the two interact. Because it is SO slippery with silicones, it allowed the makeup to “glide” onto my skin. This is great for using less makeup & easier application. HOWEVER, over time, my face began to look “sweaty/shiny”; so much so that it looked that I had applied Illuminator to my face when I wasn’t wearing any. \n\nI never have to wear setting powder unless I’m wearing a glam makeup look for a special occasion. The setting spray I normally use locks everything in place (even through heavy sweating at the gym). I wore this sunscreen inside for about 6 hours and by the end of the day, it was just not cute. I have combo skin and my whole face looked oily and felt moist *barf*. I don’t see how this product does well or stays put in place in the blazing sun. \n\nThis sunscreen was just not it and I’m not a fan.",

When I first started to apply it, I really thought I was going to hate it because it feels like silicone at first, almost like I was applying the Smashbox photo finish primer! But I let it dry down for several minutes and then applied my makeup and it instantly exceeded all my expectations. It grips my makeup so well and made my skin look completely poreless and smooth. As someone with super oily skin, this made my makeup last longer than anything else I’ve ever tried (and I’ve tried it all!) it wore so well all day long, after 12 hours I didn’t even want to take it off because it still looked so good! It didn’t feel heavy on my skin, it didn’t irritate my eyes at all, and it made my makeup look phenomenal. I love this product and I hope it sticks around forever.",

It is not reef-safe, as it contains Octocrylene (can cause brain deformities in fish larva and reproductive toxicity - imagine what it could do to humans applying it regularly on their skin - and there is evidence that it can bleach coral). It also contains Homosalate, which doesn't break down easily and has been found on sea life and corals. Bummer.",

If you want something that will look good no matter how hot it gets and will not stain even when you sweat, this is the best thing out there. It is also one that you can reapply without it feeling too gross. I can apply it over tattoos without any weird color issue as well. Usually I would assume that something of this tone and consistency would be awful for oily skin, but this isn’t bad. Obviously, it’s not matte, but it’s not crazy “dewy.” Definitely apply enough though. This is not an “a little goes a long way” product at all.",

This is what I like the most about this sunscreen, that my foundation always looks amazing over it. It seems to work as a primer because it even minimizes the look of my pores.\n- It is a non scented formula.\n- Clean at Sephora\nCONS:\n- It is a chemical sunscreen: this is just because of preference, that I prefer physical sunscreens, because this is an amazing product. \n- It is a little pricey, but the quality makes it worth it! \nI am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador",

        "review_text": "This is probably one of my favorite sunscreens I've ever tried! I've tried buying other sunscreens, mineral ones that \"don't leave a white cast\" and cheaper chemical options, and I just purchased this sunscreen for the fourth time. I also come back to this because it's a reliable choice and have had no problems. I'm Southeast Asian with a skin tone that's on the lighter side of the medium/tan range, so if I wear a 100% mineral sunscreen, my skin is light enough that it blends in but also dark enough for someone to tell that my skin tone looks off (sort of like a white cool-toned tint to my warm skin?). In other words, I just look a bit paler than usual and it looks unnatural. With this sunscreen, I don't have to think about if you can see it on my skin or if it's not blended. I usually put on more sunscreen than suggested (just to be safe), and this glides on extremely easily over my skin ( and I also didn't notice any scent/an unpleasant chemical smell). It is a bit slippery (no oils are in this, just silicones), but your skin will feel soft after rubbing it in. Speaking of which, you don't need to put in a lot of effort to apply! I had recently gotten jaw surgery and had switched to a different sunscreen (chemical, but had a white color that disappeared after rubbing in). I had incisions on the left and right side of my bottom jaw, which sunscreen would be necessary to prevent scarring, and I found that I had trouble rubbing in my sunscreen (walking into harsh lighting, I'd see white along the sides of my jaw from not blending well enough). I switched to this instead and had no problem, nor did I have to worry about having any weird coloring. The finish is a soft matte, almost similar to the Fenty Pro Filter Instant Retouch Primer. Overall, if you want an SPF that you would enjoy applying and wouldn't have to worry about looking weird or greasy, this is perfect!",

I tried Elta 46 for face but it dried out my cheeks and neck and I had very visible dry patches. I read it was because of the zinc oxide.

I was hoping for better.\n\nI'll start with the positives: it leaves zero white cast on the skin. There is no noticeable odor to it. It's a higher SPF with it being SPF 40. It truly is undetectable on the skin. People say its a great base for makeup with its silicone primer like texture. \n\nThe negatives: the texture is not pleasant, its like a silicone primer, but greasy feeling. If you use a decent amount of product (which you need to in order to get proper coverage), it pills up. I'd say my skin is slightly sensitive, and this completely broke me out- white heads, clogged pores, really deep, red pimples too. \n\nI don't see myself using/repurchasing this again, which is too bad considering how hyped it is and how many people seem to have success with it.",

It feels heavy and sticky once applied and leaves your skin looking oily. I wouldn't care all that much if it was just leaving my skin looking oily, but it physically felt like it was clogging my pores. No amount of rubbing it in helped. I had to re-wash my face to get the feeling off. I also tried it for a full day just to see how it would wear, and I swear it feels worse in the sun! It was like I was wearing a heavy face mask all day. Maybe that's what helps protect your skin, but it was not something I was used to and probably won't ever adjust to.",

As I’m rubbing this in my face, it just disappears; no scent, no weight, no stick, just nothing; the only thing I feel after is the velvety, (& invisible) soft finish it leaves on the skin.

Bonus points that it’s 100% clear, so no white cast or spending ages trying to blend. Plus, it’s not greasy and feels incredible on skin (not heavy). I have dry, sensitive, textured, acne-prone skin with mild rosacea. I’ve been using this product for about a month with no breakouts, irritation, or dry patches. It doesn’t bother my eyes either (which are usually insanely sensitive). Easy to reapply with no pilling. It’s hydrating, but dries demi-matte. It wears PERFECTLY under makeup too! I was using the COSRX aloe soothing sun cream but it caused my foundation to separate around my eyes/nose and it burned my eyes like crazy. \n\nThis stuff has been a game-changer under makeup. My foundation applies so much smoother than before! I do add a primer on top though just for that extra long-lasting effect, but even without an additional primer it DELIVERS. Cannot recommend this sunscreen enough! 100% worth the cost.",

There’s no whitecast, it is “unseen”. However, after about an hour or so, it starts to peel off and I have to keep taking these small strands/balls of product off my face. I don’t wear makeup so I’m not sure how well it does with it, but if it peels without makeup, I feel like it would be worse with makeup. I will use the rest of it, but I won’t be buying another",

My skin is on the dry/oily side depending on the time of year- but in the winter my skin wants to match the intensity of the frigid cold snow and crumble away like that granola bar you forgot is in the bottom of your bag as a safety snack. It’s not cute friends, not cute. The unseen sunscreen revitalizes my skin & lets me have peace of mind that it’s protected from not only the blazing rays of the sun- but also adds a little extra punch of hydration so that I know that despite my genetics- there’s an improved chance of my skin looking younger for longer. \n\nI cannot recommend this product enough! I apply it after washing, toning, adding my serum, and moisturizing to really lock in the moisture. It’s comfortable under makeup & doesn’t affect the texture of my BB cream. I use Supergoop!’s mineral powder to reapply sunscreen after a few hours if I am wearing makeup- otherwise if I’m not I’ll slather this on again and hit my face with a lil setting spray to feel fancy. It’s worth the money! I’m inconsistent (despite my dedication to not look like a dried up raisin) so the full sized version will last me two months. As an added bonus: You can ALSO recycle the bottle after you’ve used all of the product so you aren’t contributing to landfills while trying to keep ya skin fresh. (I may have imagined that last part but I’m nearly 87.5% sure you can recycle the type of plastic through some method or another). 15/10- recommend",

I have combo skin and many sunscreens either give me a white cast or an oily face after an hour or so. This sunscreen goes on very silky has a bit of a matte texture, but soaks into the skin in a while and gives a natural finish. I am not easily impressed by sunscreens, but this one is pretty good! Pricey, but if you’re gonna invest in one expensive skincare product, make it a sunscreen that you actually enjoy using. I don’t know how its under makeup cause I barely use any. But I feel like it’ll do well since it has primer like qualities. Knocking off a star cause its not really cheap. Hope this helps!",

I’d been debating whether to try this product for a while, then it popped up as a sample option at checkout for another purchase. I was so excited to receive my little sample packet a few days later. It is in fact completely clear and upon application feels just like any other silicone-based primer. I applied my normal skincare products first- vit C serum and moisturizer- and let them fully absorb into my skin (about 10 minutes.) Then, I squeezed out one small drop of Unseen Sunscreen and patted it on to just half my face for comparison purposes. Immediately, I noticed how much more even it made my skin. Like a fine putty, it smoothed over all my pores, lines and textured areas, leaving a flawless glowing canvas behind. I was worried about it being too mattifying since I have drier skin, but that was not the case at all. My foundation glided over this product incredibly easy, without clinging to any problem areas. I then worried that as the day wore on, my makeup would start to appear oily or slip off, but it didn’t move. Not even a little bit, and I maintained that gorgeous glow all day. \n\nAlthough the sample was enough for about 3 applications, I ordered a full size after just the first day. I’ve now used it 3 days in total, with 2 of those days having spent several hours in the sun. So far, no signs of sun damage whatsoever, even after one day where my neck and chest turned a bit red. I’m so beyond pleased with this product for not only saving me time spent applying sunscreen and primer separately, but for giving me a flawless finish. This will definitely be a product I reach for often.",

I do love that it’s at least 40 SPF although 50 would be even better. For me personally it did not work well under makeup.

I cannot say enough good things about this sunscreen. I have very fair skin and burn easily and I got no burns while in the sun all day in Costa Rica. The finish is super surprising for a sunscreen. To me it feels exactly like a primer. Very dry to the touch. It goes on like a dream bad leaves no white cast or weird shine. I would wear it every day if it weren’t so expensive so I stick to my cheaper everyday sunscreen that isn’t waterproof and save this for when I need water resistance. I am really sensitive to mineral sunscreens so if you’re like me I would trust the chemical filters supergoop has put in this product. It is fantastic. I will never use another face sunscreen for wet hot summer days! Thanks supergoop.",

I can see how folks with a darker complexion would love this because it is absolutely clear. I, however, am the palest person you've ever seen, have a very oily t-zone, prone to breakouts, have sensitive skin, and while I don't want white cast, I REALLY don't want to look or feel greasy. My main priorities are A) the SPF being effective and B) non-greasy, non-heavy. I give this 3 stars because it is definitely effective SPF, kept me burn-free. But it looks greasy on my skin immediately and feels sticky and gross like any other sunscreen. I found myself just returning to my other drugstore sunscreens. So for me it's just fine and works like any other cheaper brand. Sigh.",

Even showing my face the tube causes my eyes to burn and eczema to flare up around my mouth. So much so I often skip it. This summer instead of blowing through my pricey Bare Minerals for every day wear around the house which has spf...I decided to try tomorrow moisturizer with spf. I tried Ulta brand and it felt so heavy like I may as well have been wearing foundations plus it caused deep breakouts that took weeks to clear up. No bueno. I than moved onto pricey drug store products. Cera Ve daily face moisturizer with spf, Vichy, etc. I still needed to use my regular moisturizer underneath. Cera be felt OK but overwhelming typical sunscreen smell AND my face still felt sticky and weighted down and started having to research no-wash options for quickly cleaning my face at the end of the day to remove it, without having to go through my whole face washing routine. \n\nThen I found this while browsing at Sephora. I was looking at Shiseido and as always overwhelming with my options. I fell in love with this right then and there in the store after trying it on. \n\nI literally wear it every day. I put it on after my morning routine and know if I step outside for a walk at lunch I'm good plus what a difference it's made in helping set my eyes for the day!\n\nI can't feel it. My skin doesn't notice it T ALL!! I haven't broken out once because of this which every other spf whether for sensitive skin, non-comodogenic, etc always do. \n\nI don't even feel like I need to wash my face after putting this on and it does not bother my eczema. It doesn't smell like sunscreen at all instead I find the smell, what little there is, to be very refreshing. To me (and again it's unscented but a slight product smell) it reminds me of pool water which only enhances to experience for me as I love that smell. \n\nSo far it works because I have spent lots of time out in the sun and no color at all.",

I never knew how much difference a good primer could be until I decided to do makeup over this sunscreen and everything applied so much more evenly.

I typically prefer mineral sunscreens, but having brown skin, this was a plus for me.  It did leave a film on my face, but when I touched my skin my finger wasn’t oily. I stayed inside most of the morning and I could still feel the film. Once I went outside, I feel like the sunscreen almost dried up if you will and I didn’t feel as protected which is why I only gave it 3 stars. My skin didn’t burn or anything, but I kind of felt like the sunscreen disappeared. Never had that feeling with a mineral sunscreen unless I was really sweating or swimming.  It might be a sunscreen I would use in the winter when the sun isn’t as intense as now in the summer.  Going to try the Sheer Screen so I hope that works better for me.

Over the last several months, retinoid and prescription strength hormonal acne medication has seriously irritated and dried out my skin. This sunscreen delivers everything I need as it is highly moisturizing and soothing due to the frankincense and meadowfoam seed. The formula goes on clear, scentless, is velvety soft, and truly doubles as a make up primer! It held up my make up while moisturizing my skin in dry and hot Las Vegas summer weather. My only gripe is that when applying the recommended amount of daily sunscreen, or the 2 finger rule, it does feel like a lot on your face - therefore not weightless as it claims to be. For that reason, I’m also not sure how oily skin types will do if you’re applying the correct amount of sunscreen daily. Nonetheless, I love this formula!",

I feel like I'm rubbing and trying to smush it into my skin and getting no where. Like you're trying to get it to absorb but instead you're just spreading it around your face more. If you try and rub it in too much, I do find it'll have a gritty texture that's unpleasant. The reason I'm giving it two stars and not one is it does dry down into the skin well, which is unexpected given it's texture. I will probably to try use this product by doing two thinner layers.",

It's just a pleasant and really smooth sunscreen that feels good on the skin. It doesn't burn my eyes either, even though it's a totally chemical sunscreen. I can see this working really well as a primer underneath makeup because of the silicones, and I don't think it will break me out.

I was always hesitant to try it because the description of it feeling silicone-like made me believe that it probably wasn't going to pair nicely with makeup and my oily skin. I found that applying this evenly was a breeze and it spread easily, it is definitely undetectable and blurring and ends up setting. I have to try it under makeup as I'm trying this out after a chemical peel and can't wear any. I like that there's only one ingredient in here that has the potential to be pore clogging but that's dependent on how much of  that ingredient is used in the product itself and the users skin so this isn't even a major concern - that's definitely way less than competing spfs. I will continue to use this product.",

Always layer on a hydrating serum or moisturizer before this and you’ll be fine! Pat into skin! Load up! Apply to neck and ears! \n\nIt’s worth it.",

I'm giving it 4 stars for the following: 1) my eyes are super sensitive to something in the sunscreen and I tear up without fail when I use it, and 2) it has the SLIGHTEST smell of gasoline. The best way to describe the scent is like when you've closed your car door at a gas station but can still smell gasoline. That's what this product smells like to me. The scent is super faint, doesn't linger, and nearly undetectable once you work it in. Other than those two things, I would highly recommend it!",

However, as time went on I noticed that whenever I used this sunscreen after certain skin care products, it would ball up and peel off my face. \"Maybe I put the sunscreen on before my skin care could dry down?\" So I waited until it dried down, that didn't work! It would still ball up and peel off my face like soft silicone. I am very picky when it comes to sunscreens because my standard is Clarins, which I've been using for 5 years now. They haven't re-launched their sunscreen due to Covid. Some may not like Clarins, but it works for me. But to get to the point my standard is Clarins, I need my sunscreen to work with whatever skin care products I choose to use. I really liked this sunscreen at first: it did not break me out, I did not irritate my sensitive, dry skin. I would still recommend it, just watch out for what products you use, it may not mesh well with them.",

It makes my face not feel clean and like it’s not able to breath which is annoying. If I’m wearing makeup it’s not as bad. I did have high hopes for this and unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. I am curious about the new Sunday Riley’s sunscreen that is a hybrid of both chemical and mineral.

That is not all of it sinks in anyways. It rubs off easily no matter what I do, and it’s not an invisible feeling at all. \nI gave it two stars because it is completely “unseen” since it comes out and goes on clear so if you don’t mind a silicone texture and it never sinking in then you’ll probably like this product.",

However, that’s about where my “ooh ahh” factor ends with this product. It does have a very soft feel for texture, but feels very silicone heavy once on my face. Literally reminds me of SmashBox Photo Finish Primer, but with SPF. I never break out from products, this one made me break out like a 13 year old. First product that has done that to me in years. For $30, this is meh in a bottle for me.  I’ll pass on the pimple party and stick with my Paula’s a choice Youth Extender.",

My issue with other non-white cast sunscreens is that they have a fragrance which my skin is averse to. I do agree that it is pricey, but I'm excited to follow a fellow reviewers' advice and cut the case open when I think it is finished. I have to say that first timers but think that putting this on feels greasy and weird, but it dries down great. Putting makeup on top isn't a hassle either.",

It also looks quite natural (ie less greasy) than most chemical sunscreens I have used and the sunscreen smell is not too apparent. It dries down quickly to a natural finish, so would likely be a good option for most skin types. My biggest gripe with it is that the texture is extremely silicone-y. It almost feels like a pore filling primer if that makes any sense. I prefer sunscreens that feel more like lotions, but that’s a personal preference. For those who like that kind of effect, this may be the perfect sunscreen for you. For me, I will not be purchasing the full size once I use up the mini one that I have from the Sephora sunscreens kit.",

Since it’s clear I don’t see any type of discoloration that can come happen with other sunscreens. I took one star away simply because I don’t feel that this works as a primer like the packaging claims.

However, recently my favorite sunscreen was discontinued and as I was contemplating what my next move was I decided to finally try the Unseen Sunscreen. I decided to go all in and get the limited edition 2.5 oz and I love it! It is to be noted that I have brown skin and despise a white caste but this is clear as it comes out the bottle and even clearer on my skin. My skin is also oily but this doesn’t seem to intensify that like some sunscreens do. I don’t know if it has much of a smell but that’s a good thing, it doesn’t have that off putting sunscreen smell. My eyes are rather sensitive to certain sunscreens but this one does not irritate them. Additionally, I observed the zinc sulfate in there...in the time of covid and mask induced acne I was happy to see an ingredient with potential anti-bacterial properties in my last step skincare item...and my oily skin approves. Then there is how it works with my other skincare products, my moisturizer leaves my skin with a smooth dewy finish that I love. I was afraid this may change the results in texture and glow that I achieve with my morning moisturizer like some sunscreens are prone to doing but it doesn’t. It actually compliments it well. Lastly, I hope they keep this size around. For all the sizes they offer and quality Supergoop! is quite affordable for a non drugstore sunscreen but I get lazy and would like as much time between ordering items or running to the store as possible so I don’t mind paying the larger price tag for a larger bottle. I would love to forever be able to purchase the 2.5oz as this is now my go to sunscreen.",

In walks 2018 and the game changed for our faces. I've tried a lot of \"face\" sunblock - this is the best. I haven't tried the other Supergoop! blocks but if you're looking for a lightweight, streak-free, high SPF block, look no further. Worth every penny and lasts a relatively long time. \n\nThe initial feel of this is a little oily, but it doesn't last that way on my skin and it rubs in nicely and feels fine under makeup and over other cremes.",

I’m probably close to empty by now but this is definitely a great buy if you’re into chemical sunscreen! I’m planning on sticking with physical sunscreen for awhile but may come back to this in the future!",

I’m in my early 20’s and I’ve decided I want to start taking care of my skin in terms of sun damage and to prevent any further aging signs so I tried out this product. Let me just say, it really is unseen and unscented. It applies sort of matte and has no smell at all. It gives you virtually no shine or white cast and it’s literally invisible. It’s very lightweight and you can barely feel it. I really, really love this product. I didn’t wear any makeup over it, but it didn’t pill throughout the day either, so I’m assuming it wont under makeup. Never thought that I would feel this comfortable applying sunscreen. Will definitely repurchase when I’m done with this one!",

Also minimizes time too! I don’t recommend this sunscreen for those with very oily skin however, since it may feel too heavy. Overall, it still is a good sunscreen!!",

I’ve always struggled with the smell, the weight of it, and the white cast. This is basically a miracle. It’s somehow Smashbox Photo Finish primer with SPF. It blurs my pores and it absorbs immediately. I’m actually more than happy to wear SPF daily now. If your skin doesn’t like silicone based primers this probably won’t work for you, but if you are good with them then you should buy this immediately. They have a travel size so you don’t have to go all in to try it out, but I only had it for one day before I ordered a full size bottle.",

It also caused my pores to clog up after a couple of days of use and resulted in a bad breakout which is unusual for me (and I’m not sensitive to silicones so it’s something about the formulation in general).

It feels velvety and smooth when applying, and a little goes a decent way. So you’ll get a lot of use out of the bottle. I do notice some minimal shine later on in the day. And when I say little, I mean no more than the “end of the day shines” I normally get from running around all day anyways. It’s very lightly scented-nothing crazy or overpowering. For it being an extra layer of protection, I would recommend this! Especially for the upcoming summer months. It’s very lightweight! This will definitely be a repurchase!",

I haven't burned either, and I love that this can be used as a primer under makeup.

It happened to me TWICE and I searched it up to as why and it really was the moisturizer I was using was too thick and just sat on my skin. Please give your moisturizer some time to set then slather on the sunscreen. That’s all.",

I blame myself for buying without reading the ingredients first (something I never do but it was an impulse buy). I’m not a fun of products with silicone or silica and the second I rubbed it onto my face the first time I immediately knew there was silica and it wasn’t going to go well. If you have dry skin this is not for you. The silica will dry your face out from the moment you put it on. Also this is a chemical sunscreen that uses avobenzone as one of its active ingredients. Avobenzone is shown to break down in the sun within 30-60mins of the exposure. This does not mean it’s completely ineffective because there are other chemical sunscreen ingredients included but dermatologists and doctors recommend you either wear a physical sunscreen or use a combination if you truly want to protect your skin and this is only a chemical sunscreen. It may not seem important those of us in our teens, 20s and 30s but I know I want to protect my skin for the future. Anyway, this isn’t the one for me but I do believe SuperGoop has other good protective sunscreens!",

I have oily, acne prone skin, so I’m very picky with spf and just any skincare in general. This made me greasy within an hour of applying, which I don’t get when I use other spf. I also don’t wear makeup everyday so I can’t attest to how it wears with makeup. I’ll finish my bottle and I won’t be repurchasing it.

I saw quite a few people say it didn’t make them break out. That wasn’t the case for me. I’m on Yaz birth control, .1% Tretinoin, and Duac (5% benzoyl peroxide/1% clindamycin) for my acne. I’ve had perfect skin for quite some time now, except this sunscreen gave me small red bumps on my chin, nose area, and forehead. My whole face was also very red at the end of the day, like I had a light sunburn. \n\nAgain, it’s a nice product, but watch out if you’re sensitive. I’ve had great success with Clinique’s Pep Start tinted mineral sunscreen for a few years now, but I wanted a good sweat-proof one to layer with that because I’m so fair. I’m still on the hunt.",

Too cold, too hot, walk past an olive tree... anything. Then I developed a sun sensitivity. I don’t even have to be in the sun. Just open my door under the shade of my porch when the sun is out and BOOM! I’m as red as a baboons behind. All sunscreens (except It’sCosmetics Bye Bye Foundation SPF 45, but I don’t like covering my skin. It feels like nothing on, when applied with a light hand and when I take it off my skin isn’t red. But I don’t always want foundation.) break me out, burn, give me white caste, settle in my fine lines, are greasy or just don’t work. Except this stuff! Like... OMG! YES! My skin does get very lightly red, BUT it is not much and you can’t feel this when it goes on. Once it dries I just feel soft skin and nothing else. I can apply it every 2 hours (and unlike my It’sCosmetics Bye Bye Foundation...) it doesn’t show or get too layered. No cracking or disintegrating. No harsh smell and soft going on too. I enjoy applying it! (Faints in shock.)\n\nI do put a moisturizer on first as I have shedding lizard dry skin. With this sunscreen my skin looks great on camera... I look airbrushed. It’s mind blowing. I had a friend ask if I had gotten microdermabrasion... not in over a year!\n\nOnly 2 negatives and they are petty compared to the heck I have with other products. 1. It’s a little bit drying for me. If you have normal or oily skin this will be perfect. Even great for normal dry as opposed to my super dry skin.\n\nI have tried this lines other sunscreens. The mineral one left a caste and felt a little thick. Play smelled a little to me and made my skin uncomfortable. The stuff in the tin was very emollient, but greasy. This one seems to be the perfect formula and it’s a gel. I didn’t believe it was sunscreen at first. I might try the vitamin C mixed with this product they just came out with. I’m very excited.",

It just feels like a make-up primer (this can be used a primer tbh) that dries down. Does not leave you looking shiny or greasy. I love that it is CLEAR and dries like it! Even as someone with a lighter complexion, I don't like sunscreens that leave a white cast and this does not do that since it dries down clear. It's kinda spendy for what it is, but the tube has lasted me quite a while.",

I have combination skin and it leaves my face a tiny bit oily if I touch it, after using (it has a primer consistency) but I love that it’s vegan, doesn’t leave white cast at all, fragrance free and PA+++. It’s probably the best sunscreen I’ve ever tried, I’ll definitely be buying again and recommending to friends",

Every one that I've tried either pills, leaves a white cast, is greasy, feels gross/heavy, is shiny, or is so mattifying that I can hear the silent screams of my epidermis for any amount of hydration it can grasp. When trying it, it came out as a velvety gel. And when I put it on, it went on super smooth and clear. After it set, it wasn't shiny or mattifying, but left my skin with a slight glow and felt super soft and velvety. It felt and looked like I was wearing nothing! It also had a slight blurring effect and is basically like a really nice primer as it suggests. There was also no pilling! I am now obsessed and am fully prepared to become even more broke for this sunscreen that was officially wrapped, sealed, kissed and mailed from heaven.",

I find that if I use a heavier moisturizer such as First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair cream under it, my face feels greasy and I break out all over but if I use something lighter like Cerave or hyaluronic acid serum and skip moisturizer, my face feels just fine and I don't have any break outs. It can also be finicky with serums. I used the Ordinary's hyaluronic acid underneath this sunscreen and after about 20 minutes it began pilling, but if I used Glossier Superbounce, I have no issues. With that being said, after experimenting and finding what works with this sunscreen, I do think this is worth it due to its sheer nature and matte finish. One tube has lasted me about 5 months and I am now on my second tube.",

It has very similar consistency to Smashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer but with the added bonus of sunscreen. There is no white cast (although my skin is pretty light). This sunscreen somehow blurs your pores so I use it daily even when I don't apply makeup. I haven't burned when using it but if I'm going to the pool or beach I usually take more precautions, using several layers of different sunscreens on my face because I'm sensitive to burning. \n\nSide note: If you use this and experience pilling when you apply it, it is not compatible with whatever product you put on your face beforehand. I have one lotion that causes this - all others have been compatible.",

I’m already on the borderline where power and sunscreen can make me look ghostly, so the fact that this is clear is a game changer for me.

I have drier combo skin, so I don't get oily nor shiny with this. I only wish the skin protectant ingredients were mineral, rather than chemical, but I suppose I wouldn't be able to have the \"no white cast.\" So hence my mixed feelings, but will lean more positive considering I have been using this on the daily moreso than the mineral Play that I bought before it was removed from Sephora.",

The US is notoriously behind when it comes to sun protection — the FDA hasn’t approved new filters in decades, an issue that doesn’t appear even close to changing anytime soon. With all these limitations, Supergoop still managed to create a very elegant product with no white cast and with a texture that most people will find enjoyable to work with. \n\nBetter yet, this doubles as the perfect blurring primer for people who wear makeup. Even if you don’t wear makeup, you’ll probably appreciate the diminished appearance of your pores. The finish of the Unseen Sunscreen isn’t dewy nor mattifying. Instead, it’s got a natural finish and a velvety feel. \n\nI’m not giving it five stars because, while this has pretty high protection against UVB rays (the ones that cause burning and cancer), it doesn’t offer much against UVA rays (the ones that cause wrinkles and other signs of aging). At $34 for 50ml, it’s also very, very expensive, especially when sunscreen is something that needs to be reapplied throughout the day. If you can afford it, though, I recommend!",

It’s not the smell of a typical sunscreen and it’s not the smell of a perfume, it’s incredibly hard to describe but I don’t think it’s too offensive. \nI really enjoy this product overall, it doesn’t irritate my skin and it does work really well as a sunscreen even when I’m sweating and swimming. I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the price is a little ridiculous even if I find the product worth it, and because the smell when first applied can be off putting. But overall it makes my skin look good, a little of it goes a long way, it doesn’t pill when reapplied, and I will buy it again.",

I think the only difference may be that the Murad one has some anti-aging benefits but i'm in my young 30's and am using Dr. Dennis Gross peelpads that have great anti-aging benefits already. might as well save some $$ where I can and stick with this!

I do not use moisturizer when I use this sunscreen, I feel like if I do, I will be a tad too greasy looking. So if you are on the oilier side, skip the moisturizer and head straight to this",

They mostly came off when I gently wiped it with my finger but it still bothers me that I cant rub in the sunscreen for fear of it pilling in the dry areas. I do think that its not clogging and didn't cause any irritation and it does make my skin soft. So if you don't mind having to deal with minor pilling in the dry areas of your face then going for this product is fine. The smell is nice and light and Im curious to see how this will perform under makeup because I bought this for more protection under my dior makeup but if the pilling shows up once I put the makeup on I will be returning this. Just  make sure to put the product in ur hands and then pat it on to your face light until it absorbs to hopefully cancel out any pilling.",

I started having break outs and could not figure out why. Basically simplified my skin care routine to only using gentle cleansers and moisturizers and still the break outs remained. I have DRY skin and I also thought it was weird that by mid-day I would feel like a grease ball and felt like I needed to wash my face. Then I had the aha! Moment where the only thing I hadn’t tried to eliminate was this spf. Went a week without wearing this spf, no longer felt like a grease ball and the break outs started to clear up. Decided I can’t continue to not wear spf and after that week of not wearing this I went back and literally by the end of the day I became a pizza face again. So - long story long - it cause my dry skin to feel greasy and caused break outs.",

It wasn’t until I fully emerged myself in skincare a few months ago that I learned the truth! Everyone needs protection from the sun, regardless of your ethnicity. I struggled with finding an SPF that didn’t give me that yucky thick white cast OR leave my skin feeling greasy. Let me just say...this formula is AMAZING and ALL SKIN TONE INCLUSIVE. It’s very light + gives a nice velvet matte finish. I was concerned that the sunscreen would clog my pores, cause breakouts, etc. But it’s so light, it seems impossible that it would do that. It also makes for a great primer, my makeup has never flaked or felt different with this underneath. I can layer additional primers and my makeup still feels and looks great. My skin actually feels softer with this product and I love the feeling of walking outside knowing that I am protected from the sun!! \n\nI’d recommend this product to everyone w/ any skin type or concern. As long as they continue to make this product, it will remain a staple in my skincare routine!",

The glow screen product is 5 STARS I absolutely love it. I am not going to lie this product feels like smearing expired canola oil over your face. It has a very bizarre smell but definitely chemical-y. The glow screen is a bit thicker, doesn’t smell and dries quicker. The unseen does mattefiy over time but it takes about an hour. I would not use this under makeup as it is a little too slick. I have combo and acne prone skin. This did not make me break out which is great, but the product is not worth the price. Go buy the glow screen instead!!",

I pair with with the Sephora brand matte moisturizer and its great even for my oily t-zone. It also serves as a primer and sits well under foundation.

I only ever used sunscreen when I'd have to be in direct sunlight for a long period of time and I had no idea you could buy sunscreen that isn't disgusting and from your local store. After doing research on anti-aging and looking for the right sunscreen, I have decided that Supergoop is undoubtedly the one for me. I did have an extremely hard time paying this much for sunscreen! Thank goodness I did! It feels amazing and truly is Unseen. It looks like vaseline but you immediately find out it's not. I obviously haven't seen any physical effects, but I know I'm decreasing my chances of seeing damage by using it. I'm so thankful for finding this product. It's worth every penny.",

It reminds me of a primer, and I often use it that way. It’s smoothing on the skin, and gives a satin/matte finish.\n\nThat being said, I saw the ramifications of this product after a few weeks of daily use. This product contains high level of dimethicone (that’s what gives it the smoothing quality), which can clog pores. I was hoping that when applied on top of my other skincare, this wouldn’t break me out, but alas, it did. I don’t have sensitive skin, but I do have acne prone skin, and as a result I can’t use this product daily.\n\nIt’s not a wash though!

Coincidentally however, I’m the kinda girl that always feels the need to wear makeup as well. At first the two ideas sound incompatible, no? Not with this product, after I use this formula I feel as though I combined a moisturizer with a makeup primer, which creates the perfect canvas to do a beautiful, bronzed look, all while protecting my delicate skin in the process. My new cult favorite in both skincare and beauty. Thanks, SUPERGOOP!",

With this bad boy I don’t need make up primer and it sets my make up beautifully. It doesn’t break me out, and a little goes a long way. I can use it on days when I’m bare faced as well and it doesn’t make me oily. The tube has lasted me about 2 months so far and I have a bit over half left, so it does last a good while. A+ from me!",

Then I realized how important it is to protect your face from the sun (esp once you hit your 30s). Soooo this is the FIRST sunscreen I’ve ever tried on my face and I love it. I would not use anything else. It goes on clear so no white cast. Very silky on your face. Doesn’t leave any sticky tacky feeling at all and doesn’t leave me oily. I use this product in this order: moisturizer, supergoop, face primer, and powder foundation.

Because of the loose undefined idea of what “reef safe” is considered in a government regulation sense, it kind of just let’s companies who want to slap the label on of reef safe have free reign with whatever irresponsible marketing they want, even if it does potentially harm marine life in some form or another. When I saw the ingredients, I didn’t end up buying it. I’m sure it applies and feels as beautifully as many people like to claim it to be but I do not personally support this type of advertising and the ingredients in it. I don’t think I personally would even trust a brand as a whole who chooses to partake in the usage of misleading claims that are either harmful to people or the environment— I don’t know, a bit too sketch for my taste.",

I was prepared to buy something else from that alone but the worst part was after daily use this made the skin around my mouth dry out and turn red. So much so that my skin would get really flakey. It didn’t hurt it was just very noticeably red and dry/flakey. As soon as I stopped using it the problems went away. When I tried to use again it started back up so I finally gave up on it.",

The product is a gel and so lightweight!! Doesn’t even feel like I have anything on my face, with a matte appearance. Love that it doesn’t have a sheen or a sunscreen scent. I will be buying again! I’m so pleasantly surprised and such a fan of this sunscreen!!!",

        "review_text": "I live in Hawaii where the sun is intense and swimming is done in the ocean. The preservation of our islands is very important to us, and chemical sunscreens are polluting our beautiful beaches and snorkeling spots. For this reason, the state has banned the sale of oxybenzone and octinoxate, ingredients found in conventional chemical sunscreens that lead to coral bleaching. So naturally, I was in search of a reef safe sunscreen with a light weight formula for daily use. I soon learned that this is NOT the product I was looking for. While Supergoop’s formulas do not contain oxybenzone or octinoxate, they still contain chemicals such as avobenzone and octocrylene that have been found to be harmful to marine eco health as well. Plus, chemical sunscreens work by absorbing into the skin and have been linked to endocrine disruption and skin sensitivity. The gel went on light and matte upon first application, but there was a distinct acrid chemical smell that followed. The next day my skin, though not burnt, was rough dry and scaly. Mineral sunscreens that contain non-nano zinc oxide or non-nano titanium dioxide are generally recognized as the only safe and effective UVA / UVB protection that do no harm marine ecosystems. I’ve since discovered there are many non-nano mineral sunscreens on the market with excellent light weight formulas that leave no white cast, are safe for your skin, and kind to our oceans. I wanted to share my findings, since this seems to be a popular sunscreen choice amongst Sephora shoppers. Great reviews, labeled clean and reef safe, reasons why you may consider purchasing this product and reasons that convinced me to give it a try as well. But upon further research, I realized Supergoop’s marketing is an example of greenwashing. Please be aware of buzzwords like “reef safe” and “clean” as there are no regulations for these labels, and they are often used to mislead consumers. A good reminder to research ingredients and shop mindfully.",

Hi, wow, jeez, hellooooo AMAZING – clear, lightweight, matte, and quick to absorb. It doesn't feel like you're wearing anything and doesn't make my skin sweat. Layers seamlessly with moisturizers, is easy replies, and honestly, I could just wear this AS a moisturizer.  When it's sunny and humid there's really no face-sweat feeling. \n\nTL;DR if you don't like heavy sunscreens, aren't a fan of heavy creams, don't like oily white screen, have oily skin, and want a fast-absorbing, no 'sweaty skin' formula.

But I got this as a sample and ended up buying the full size because of how nicely it wears. \n\nI was previously using Shiseido Urban Environment sunscreen but the problem I was running into was that even though Shiseido is super smooth, it still takes some rubbing in to make sure I don’t leave a white cast behind. I’ve tried the tinted version and that also just leaves behind a beige cast. \n\nWhat’s nice about this sunscreen is that it is also super smooth, albeit in a different way. It feels like it glides over my skin. The other benefit with chemical sunscreens is that you can continue to moisturize over them throughout the day and it won’t be blocked by the mineral sunscreen layer underneath - which makes sense for me because I have dry skin and I use a hydrating primer over my sunscreen. \n\nAnyway, I love this sunscreen. It’s cheaper than Shiseido, absorbs really well, glides beautifully, doesn’t irritate my skin at all, and still lets me get max benefits from my hydrating primer.",

I know everyone preaches sunscreen for everyday but I work from home and don’t go outside everyday so I never saw the needed it on a regular basis. I’ve always used sunscreen for my face when I’m outside with no makeup and when I did wear makeup I’d grab a foundation with spf in it. Now I’m inching closer to my 30s (be 29 soon) and skin care is becoming more of a concern. I don’t have any issues with acne, spots or wrinkles but I want to be proactive and keep my skin this way. \n\nI started researching different options and tried a few. The few that I tried, had the consistency of sunscreen and didn’t work well under makeup even with a primer. This product caught my eye.\n\nThis products has the clean at sephora seal. That makes it more intriguing. I cared about chemicals in my products until I got pregnaNt a few years ago. Once you start reading labels you will be shocked as to what is in products you use on your body.\n\nBack to the sunscreen, I was skeptically the  claims that it can be used as a primer so the first few times I used it, I used primer before my makeup. Since I’m a new mom and always looking to cut out an extra step, I tried just using this as a primer and it worked perfect. Honestly it looks and feels just like the smash box primer but this is better because of sunscreen. The consistency is nothing like sunscreen. \n\nWhen reading more about the product it stated that it had blue light protection for your skin. I was like, what?! That’s something else I have to worry about?!? Apparently staring at your phone and laptop all day isn’t only bad for your mood, eyes, brain, body...it’s bad for your freaking skin too!! Now, maybe blue light effect on skin is all a marketing ploy to get everyone to buy it. BUT idk about you but with my skin, id rather be safe than sorry. \n\nDef recommend",

They are pricier than drugstore sunscreens but you really get what you pay for and you can often buy these products with discounts offered on the supergoop site and with coupons or seasonal sales at Sephora and Ulta. This is the sunscreen I use as a primer for my everyday makeup. It is clear so you don’t have to worry about any white cast - even for darker skin tones - which is so important. It goes on silky - like a silicone primer - and has a light, smooth feel to the skin after application. It is not tacky or greasy AT ALL! I feel like this is doing great things to protect my fair skin from the Texas sun while providing a good base for makeup and helps my skin rather than causing irritation, breakouts, or oil-slick on my face like other sun protection products. It does have a light sun-screen smell which I assume comes from the active sunscreen properties but it is not overwhelming and dissipates quickly. Would highly recommend!",

It’s so different than anything else I have ever tried and I see why people really love this. The texture is like nothing else, it almost feels and looks like a soft balm but as soon as you spread it on your skin, it disappears and leaves no cast on my skin, it leaves my skin looking even and a bit matte. The texture is nice and you can reapply it without worrying about pilling or anything crazy. I’ve had weird reactions from other sunscreens but this one has performed so well I almost wish I could buy the full size. But some dermatologists have noted that the filters in the sunscreen don’t really provide the best coverage unless you use tons and tons of it throughout the day and I’m looking for something that I can reapply and know that I’m being protected for sure.",

It felt like it wasn’t truly absorbing into my skin just laying like a film on top. Unfortunately, every time I used this I woke up the next day with tiny white heads in my face. It honestly made me face feel sooooo dirty. Wanted to love it but can’t :/ If anyone is looking for a sunscreen specifically for their faces and has sensitive and or acne prone skin I recommend Shisedo’s. I used them for years prior to trying Supergoop and never had any breakout issues nor sensitivity. The only con was it left a white cast for a bit on your face whereas the Supergoop one does not.",

I’ve always known how important it is to wear sunscreen everyday but almost everyone I tried left my sensitive skin feeling greasy, uncomfortable, or weirdly pale. But then I got unseen sunscreen in a play box and I’ve been hooked ever since! It goes on so smooth and silky and gives my skin such a nice finish that I usually don’t even put foundation on over it. Plus it WORKS! I literally hiked the Grand Canyon wearing this product and it stayed on the whole time! It is an absolute must have and I highly recommend it!",

I blush quite easily, but this made my cheeks turn bright red at random points throughout the day for seemingly no reason — the photo I attached is even after most of the redness went away. The only other product that has ever done that for me is the elf primer, and this has a similar texture to that, so I’m guessing they have an ingredient in common that doesn’t agree with me. I’m sure this works great for a lot of people and it’s fantastic if you’re looking for a sunscreen that doubles as a primer, but if you’re prone to redness or have had similar reactions to silicon-based primers before, maybe avoid this one. (I’ve marked that I wouldn’t recommend it because I had to choose one, but I honestly think it just depends on your skin!)",

So, I took to the internet to see what other products were out there and found this. I agree, it is pricey for the size, I've been buying mine on Verishop, but since Sephora now sells a jumbo size, I'll definitely be getting it here from now on! This sunscreen is AMAZING, no white sheen, no shine, just great, matte sun protection. I do find that it's not as moisturizing as the Image brand one I was using previously, so I actually layer my Vanicream face lotion underneath this. I do not wear foundation so I don't know how well it does under makeup. I do have oily, acne prone skin, but I did a treatment of Accutane a year ago. I still get small breakouts from time to time due to hormones, but I do not notice that this product makes them worse or causes breakouts for me. I also do not notice any difference in sun protection between this and my old sunscreen, but I do have more olive toned skin that is a bit more resilient to the Sun than fair skin. However, when I do burn, it's my face and shoulders typically so I like to protect those areas when I'm out and about.",

This is so smooth, silky, and luxurious when you apply it (but feels different to me than a silicone primer).  There is absolutely no trace of it on your face as it is completely clear.  I also love that it has a little higher SPF than most facial sunscreens.  I have yet to use it under makeup, but I don't anticipate it being a problem.  I did not have any piling.  You really can't even tell it's on!  Will definitely repurchase.  I hope they keep the 2.5 oz. value size.",

I used to use Neutrogena clear face sunscreen, which left a sticky shiny residue, then layer Smashbox photo finish primer on top before makeup. The layering felt heavy sometimes. With this, I only need one product to do both and feel lighter on my skin. For traveling and daily morning routines, it is more convenient to only need one product instead of two. It applies with a matte-to-natural finish in the morning, but after 5+ hours at work in front of a computer it starts to shine a bit. I just blot and my makeup stays in place and doesn't transfer or fade. My face has never gotten sunburnt while wearing this. 9.8/10 highly recommend",

Does not pill when it comes into contact with my moisturizer, does not melt off my skin in the heat, and keeps everything together when I wear make up. Definitely protects my skin because my scars have not darkened! I only wish it was a little cheaper since I will probably be re-stocking this always. I use it every day and the standard size has lasted me 2 months. Can't say enough about this product.",

This product is now one of my favorites and makes putting on sunscreen much more enjoyable as this one doesn’t leave a white residue or ANY residue for that matter.

I only use it when I’m not wearing any foundation or concealer bc for some reason it always makes everything on top pill so you’re left with little tinted balls all over your face, not cute.

The protection is good, I used it in Joshua tree (a desert) and accidentally only applied once in the day but didn’t end up with a sunburn which is pretty good since I’m pasty and very prone to burn. Supergoop has other sunscreens that are better, research my loves! Also this is a chemical sunscreen, which, eeek, read some stuff it’s kinda scary and also NOT reef safe!

The texture is super lightweight and almost gelatin-like without being goopy. When you apply it, the only way you know you have it on is because your skin will be so much smoother but the product really disappears! No white cast, greasy residue or irritating feeling.

I hate the way sunscreen feels on my face, even Neutrogena's feels like a film I want to wash off by the end of the day.  This one has such a unique texture and feels velvety soft once it finishes absorbing in a few seconds.  I love how it's clear and doesn't make my skin look light and patchy.  I don't wear foundation or makeup on a daily basis, so I can't speak on how well it performs as a primer, but I can imagine it's good.

It works great as a primer BUT after doing some research, it is NOT enough as a standalone sunscreen. I learned it has to be layered with other SPF products to get the full effect of a normal sunscreen as the \"SPF 40\" is diluted by the primer qualities. In other words, you have to wear another real sunscreen before putting on this primer that just happens to have a small fraction of the SPF you actually need. I think it's irresponsible marketing for Supergoop to say this is simply Sunscreen all over the packaging when the primary function is just a primer. If I knew this earlier, I would have layered more SPF products for more protection on my face the entire past year as I was exposed to more UV rays than I ever expected.",

It was great under makeup and fairly matte. But I couldn't imagine that was enough product necessary in order to get full/even SPF coverage. I reached out to Supergoop customer service since it doesn't say anywhere how much to apply. The rep told me about a dime size. She said she uses the Mattescreen and uses about a marble size herself. So when I tried using a bigger amount, but still less than a dime size, the great primer quality of it was reduced as it became a little too slippery. I'm using this for the SPF benefits, not just as a makeup primer so it needs to look nice and work well when I have the correct amount applied.\nBut the bigger issue with this is that is broke me out HORRIBLY. I never break out. I have sensitive skin that will react to products sometimes by getting red/irritated, but almost nothing breaks me out. I am presently trying to treat and heal some major blemishes caused by this and I also have about 10 of those tiny barely raised whiteheads that i don't even know what to do with. \nI just returned this and will try the Farmacy's sunscreen now.",

Easy to travel with, the cap stays on well, and it stands up well on its cap.\n-The texture is very slick, it slides on the face well and sinks in quickly.\n-The finish is beautiful. It dries down to a soft velvet finish that layers well underneath makeup, or looks beautifully diffused without makeup. \n-Works very well as a primer for makeup, specifically wetter foundations (does not work suuuper well with dryer or stick formulations). It feels like it seals in the skincare. \n-Mineral sunscreen and reef-safe!\n\n\nCons:\n-I have very acne-prone skin, and this has a bunch of dimethicone in it. I started breaking out about a week after using, and I was cycling through my skincare wondering what the problem is. I took a break for three days, and no new spots and all of my spots have gone down. I am so bummed because I love everything about this sunscreen, but I just cannot wear it with the amount of dimethicone in the formulations.",

I thought maybe it was hormonal, so I waited a week and let everything try and calm down. I wore this again a few days ago and it was the ONLY thing I put on my skin all day. I cleansed my face well that night and when I woke up, I had three new pimples in random spots.\n\nI don't normally get acne so I'm pretty confident that this must have been comedogenic or something. I didn't have an allergic reaction, just surprise pimples in odd spots all over my face.  \n\nI'm young 20s with combination skin and I don't wear makeup except for mascara, so I'm pretty confident that this product was the problem for me.

With that being said, \nPros: it’s feels super soft and did not make me break out \nCons: it takes up more foundation to cover my face than usual, it makes my T-zone waaaayyy oilier than it used to, and once my face gets oily, it begins to oxidize my foundation. Then my foundation will cake around some spots, for example around my nose, and come off around the rest of my nose, tzone, and any other super oily spot. I feel like I don’t wanna touch my face to even scratch it cus it’ll remove my foundation and/or slide it around. \n\nI really wanted to like it, but the same thing keeps happening every day with my skin getting oilier, foundation sliding around/off. I’m gonna have to return it :(",

First, the cost for such a small amount is outrageous. I use sunscreen every day (face, ears, front and back of neck) and while I like the coverage this provides, it's not cost effective to buy. Second, because it's more of a gel-like substance, and clear, I never feel like I've used enough nor covered all my exposed skin, so I use even more. I do like that it has not caused any breakouts and leaves my skin smooth to the touch (it would make a decent primer), though.

I will say though, I add this after my moisturizer and when applying it my moisturizer rubs off a bit if that makes sense, but I dont mind.

The texture is primer-like and it layers beautifully on top of my skincare. My foundation grips to it and stays in place all day long!

However, I recently went on vacation to FL and used this sunscreen while on the beach one day and I am so disappointed with how it held up. I ended up switching to neutrogena a few hours in because my face was sunburnt and now I am left with a tomato red face and a clearly defined tan line from my sunglasses. I thought that this product would hold up well in extreme sun exposure, but instead I fried. Given this, I’m hesitant to think that the SPF protection I think I’m receiving on an every day basis is even effective. 2 stars only because it lays well as a primer for makeup.",

It felt lightweight, i could wear it without looking like a ghost, and I was feeling myself knowing my skin was protected. After a couple weeks/months of wear, I started to notice that I was breaking out like crazy, with deep pimples popping up on my cheeks and forehead. I was certain it had to be something else, so I started to play with my skincare routine, but that wasn't it. It wasn't until recently that I realized that the only constant during this period of breakout has been the Supergoop sunscreen, and after doing a little research, I have seen that some others have faced similar struggles. I guess my skin does not love the formula, and I am sad bc its back to the drawing board for me!",

It has a velvety texture that smooths the look of pores and won't make you greasy at all, the texture is similar to that of a primer but if you give it a minute it will absorb completely. If I don't put this on in the morning, no matter how many mattifiers, I will be shiny and greasy a few hours later but not with this. Have you ever actually WANTED to put on sunscreen? Because Supergoop did it y'all, I look forward to it every day.

I hate the smell, the feel, the look, all of it. \n\nBut THIS product, this Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen? It's sunscreen for people like me who hate sunscreen. It's going on my face whenever I leave the house now. It's an amazing primer in addition to being an awesome sunscreen that doesn't even feel or act like a sunscreen, which is incredible. \n\nMy only minor quibble is that even after having it on for 12  hours, I can still \"taste\" it. I obviously didn't put it on my lips, but I could taste it in my mouth all day. I have a very sensitive sense of smell, so I'm probably just smelling it because it's on my face and somehow that's translating to tasting it, so I hope I can get used to that.",

I have super oily skin, so I thought this would be perfect for me as most other sunscreens make me look greasy and gross. I love wearing makeup, so having skincare that doesn't pill is a must for me. Unfortunately, this sunscreen pills like crazy on me. I thought that maybe it was the combination of this and some other product so I eliminated all the unnecessary skincare and just used moisturizer. I tried it over tatcha, FAB, la mer, and fresh, but this sunscreen still pilled up!! Don't recommend for makeup lovers, but instead recommend the Everyday Sunscreen also by Supergoop. That one doesn't pill and blocks both UVA / UVB really well. It does look greasy when you apply but after powdering, it lasts and is fine for the entire day.",

I can get pretty teary-eyed when it comes to sunscreens and this did not make my eyes water. No white cast and minimal greasiness. No pilling. A little bit goes a long way. CONS: Made me break out badly especially on the cheeks but I kept using it because of the price and because I was excited that it was so lightweight.

This sunscreen does not leave a white cast, doesn't make my skin oily and hasn't broken me out yet. I've been using this over my Clinique moisturizer and the two pair perfectly well. I have not tried this under make up yet but the texture of this sunscreen feels like a primer so I have no reason to believe that it will not sit flawlessly under makeup. I have finally found a sunscreen that I want to reapply every two hours! I absolutely love it and could not recommend it enough.",

Initially I was very hopeful because most sunscreens leave me looking gray since I have medium skin. This product lives up to its \"unseen\" marketing which is great but not at the expense of oily makeup and a painful breakout! I have extremely dry skin so I have no idea how this made me oilier than usual. My experience also does not align with the claim that it leaves a \"velvety matte\" finish. My skin is also very clear and I don't usually get painful under the skin zits. I knew right away this product was the culprit because it was the only thing that changed from my usual routine and I felt the breakout coming on as the day progressed with me having this product under my makeup. Haven't had a breakout since. Also nowhere on the packaging does the product say non-comedogenic or dermatologist tested but yet their website FAQs claim it is... very strange. DO NOT RECOMMEND if you have sensitive skin.",

Now that I’m in my early 30s and my job requires me to be in the sun daily, I’ve noticed some dark spots appearing on my face from sun damage. This SPF has tremendously changed my mind on wearing sun protection on my face and makes me truly feel like I’m wearing nothing but ready to take better care of my skin for this next decade of sun exposure! Anyone that I’ve had try this stuff has been happy with the texture and the protection! Definitely a staple in my outdoor bag!",

My makeup would not set the way it normally would. So I washed off everything and started all over. This time I applied hourglass foundation over the sunscreen and it did not pill but after about an hour my skin started to get oily. \nTo make the long story short, I tried this sunscreen many different ways, with different lotion, different setting powders. In all honesty, it just didn’t do well with any of my makeup combinations. It was best with no makeup.\nI give 1 star because after using it for about a month, I can see my left side of my face has became darker from driving. Which means this sunscreen really didn’t help with the sun protection as it claims. It might just be a great primer for some but not as a sunscreen. I’m starting to think any sunscreen that has a primer bonus might not be effective as just pure sunscreen.",

My sister serendipitously recommended this sunscreen to me shortly before I traveled to Europe, and I used it almost every day. (I used an SPF'd foundation the first couple of days, but I was sweating so much that it wasn't worth the effort to pretend to look fancy.)\n\nDoes this sunscreen work? YES.\n\nI applied it in the mornings before venturing out for all-day adventures. I reapplied once on days that involved the beach and water to the face. Unlike my shoulders (and an unfortunate strip on my back), my face never burned. Not even a little.\n\nNow, I am a pale, indoorsy, Irish-heritage'd type who burns before tanning, so if there had been a burn, it would have been quite obvious (dare I say... painfully obvious?).\n\nBUT MY FACE DID NOT BURN. Equally as important, MY EYES DID NOT BURN. It was humid, the heat index was 100  (F, not C), and I was outside for-ev-er for a week-plus. Sweat happened. Burning eyes and skin did not. This is basically a miracle, because there were days that my jean shorts were completely soaked through. (With sweat. It's exactly as gross as it sounds.)\n\nThis sunscreen's dimethicone-y aspects make it easy-peasy to apply. A dollop the size of a rather large pea usually takes care of my entire face. There's no extra shine and no stickiness (#bless).\n\nIs this product perfect? Alas, no. I am sensitive of skin, so consistently applying anything (besides my daily moisturizer) will eventually lead to some surface unhappiness. So, as excellent as this sunscreen is, let your skin take a break every so often.\n\nIf you're about to sweat it out, give this a try. You might be pleasantly surprised (and gloriously unburned!).",

        "review_text": "was excited at first. . .then i looked up the ingredients....here's what i found.  \n\n￼\n\n0\n\n￼\n\nWhat Is Avobenzone and Is It Safe In Sunscreen?\n\nAvobenzone was introduced in the 1990s and is a common chemical sunscreen. Unlike other chemical sunscreens that just protect from the sunburn-causing UVB rays, avobenzone also protects from UVA rays, the rays that cause premature aging and skin cancer. This chemical is given a two rating by the EWG. So what’s wrong with avobenzone? It seems like a safe sunscreen, right?￼\n\nWhat’s wrong with avobenzone?\n\nAvobenzone, by itself, is relatively safe in terms of toxicity, but it breaks down quickly in the sun. Once exposed to the sun, avobenzone alone only offers about 30 minutes of protection.[i] Since UVA rays are the sneaky rays that do their damage deep within the layers of your skin, you wouldn’t even know it until many years later.\n\nWhy is avobenzone used in sunscreen?\n\nSo maybe you’re asking why they don’t they just use an ingredient that is better friends with the sunshine. We wish we knew! Because many chemical sunscreen companies still use avobenzone for UVA protection, they then have to add not-so-safe chemicals like octocrylene to make it work longer than 30 minutes.[ii] Octocrylene helps stabilize avobenzone, which is good, but it is a known endocrine disruptor that also releases free radicals.[iii] Not good. Skin sample tests showed there were more free radicals when using octocrylene than skin exposed to the sun with no sunscreen at all.[iv] And remember, free radicals, also known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), can damage skin cells and increase the risk for cancer and other health issues.[v]",

I like how smooth it feels, I like that it’s odorless, and I like how it mattes my skin.

I read the comments on this and got it as a birthday gift over a month ago. The texture is great, it reminds me of a matte make up primer, which is exactly what it can be used for as well (I have not tried it under make up). It does help blur pores and has done a good job keeping me from getting too burnt under the sun (but it is not sweat nor water proof - so you do need to reapply!). It does have kind of a funny smell but it's not incredibly noticeable. Next time I would probably prefer one that can stand water and sweat more. I would recommend this more so for those who want a sunscreen based primer under their make up.",

I only applied this once and didn’t burn. The only part of me that burned was the top of my head and a little of my forehead where I hadn’t put it on. I am buying the full size for sure.",

So I wasn't at all opposed to getting a free sunblock, even if it was a tiny amount. Then, I went to apply some before my makeup and realized it was a primer. That honestly excited me sooooo much. Even more exciting was the fact that it preforms almost exactly like the Smashbox primer we all know and love. So not only is it a sunscreen, it's also an awesome primer. I've used this everyday this summer and the only other SPF product I've used on my face is the Tarteguard SPF powder and not only have I remained completely burn free while still spending quite a bit of time outdoors, I haven't darkened at all. I get most people probably want to be tan but I try my hardest to maintain a fair complexion year round for anti aging purposes. 10/10 combo. I'll continue to buy and use this every summer",

It is similar to smash box primer—has a slick texture and it is clear which is a plus. I think if you’re blessed with naturally beautiful skin and not so sensitive this might work. I wanted the higher spf this product offers but not at the expense of having bumpy skin :( I think glossier is a good alternative if you are looking for that clear/transparent look. But for now I’ll stick to hourglass veil primer even with the low spf and whitish look...hope this helps",

I've been using it for over a year, and have yet to develop a pimple (I have sensitive skin, and I sweat a lot on my face when I'm having hot flashes!).  Enter Unseen Sunscreen.  Super lightweight, and feels like silk going on, and it's super blendable.  You can do it without looking in the mirror, how many sunscreens can you say that about?  Foundation (I use liquid) glides right on over it, as if I just applied a primer.  I have many ways of wearing this sunscreen.  Sometimes, I use the Supergoop city sunscreen serum underneath, especially when I feel I need that extra layer of moisture.  That dries on quickly.  Then, I add a half and half  plop of Unseen Sunscreen and my liquid foundation (Sephora 10-hour), and mix them up on my fingers and apply to my face.  The whole process takes less than a minute, and my skin feels light, and non-greasy, with just the right amount of coverage.  If I'm heading out for outdoor activities I apply this without the foundation to get the maximum SPF from it.  My skin feels so dewy, yet not greasy! For full makeup coverage, I apply the foundation AFTER the Unseen Sunscreen.  I do that for events where I want full coverage makeup.  Love this goop!!",

The product does smooth out my skin like a primer would, which is so nice, however I will say that it doesn’t not really control oil or extend the wear of my makeup. I didn’t really expect it to, so I’m only taking one star off.

It's clear and leaves a velvety finish on the skin once massaged into the skin, unlike my Glossier sunscreen which was actually the culprit of my melting makeup!

So, I'm going to have to stop use. It is most likely from the silica.

I've tried gently wiping it on, and the sunscreen begins to turn into almost a powder that will ball up on your face. Patting it on eliminates that problem, but then you also have to pat on your foundation with a sponge. Not the biggest problem, and I'll adapt if it gets me a matte and invisible sunscreen.

The sun protection works great and it doesn't cause any issues under my Fenty foundation (might not be as cooperative with non-matte foundations though). I have normal/combo skin that tends toward oily, and it works well for me, but my mom has dry skin and it pills on her (I let it set, but I'm not sure if she does). I've used Dr. Jart's BB with spf 40, which doesn't have the silicone feel to it, and I'm more likely to repurchase the Dr. Jart's for everyday SPF than this, I think.

I've tried dozens of formulas from drugstore to the most high-end, the highly touted K and J beauty products, local brands, you name it. They were all okay, some certainly were better than others. \n\nThe issue is that not a single one of these formulas made me want to apply sunscreen every day. It felt like a chore that got in the way of the rest of my routine. \n\nThat's where this sunscreen comes in. I knew when I tried it that it wouldn't leave a white cast, but I wasn't prepared for how nicely it would absorb into my skin. It feels more like a primer than a sunscreen. It isn't greasy, nor is it drying. The ingredients are wonderful - nothing that would cause my sensitive skin to break out. I am actually excited to apply sunscreen every morning now - and while this sunscreen is a little pricey, it's honestly not bad considering the quality you're paying for. I'm on a mission to get my family and friends to care about applying SPF every day, and I'm so glad sunscreens like this exist to make people feel excited and good about protecting their skin.\n\n(Also - the packaging is incredibly cute.

It goes on so smoothly and because it is clear I don't have that ashen finish I get from tinted sunscreens. It also feels amazingly silky on my face and is perfect under make up. Works as a primer too. My husband uses it as well so we will be buying more when we are done with our current tube. Thank you SUPERGOOP! :)",

It does seem to add slightly to my oil problem but I’ve found that it helps to wait until it dries down completely before applying foundation. I have worn it on several sunny days that I have been outside for hours at a time and have experienced no redness or sunburn. I do make sure to reapply after swimming or sweating a lot.

I was hesitant to try this for the first time as I usually have sensitive skin and break out easily with products that don't agree with my normally oily skin.\nHowever, I was very impressed with this product. Unlike other sunscreens this isn't a white oily substance and it didn't 'bleed' or run off in the water. It's more like a semi-transparent, yellowish, lightweight, creamy matte gel--I'm not sure how else to explain it. When I spread it over my face it was like spreading velvet, it dried clear and was not oily.\nMost importantly, it didn't make me break out or cause a rash, and it protected my face from becoming sunburned. I let my husband, mother-in-law and nephew try this product and they were impressed with the texture as well. Another point to mention: my nephew has sensitive skin too, and this didn't make him breakout either.\nNow I'm here to purchase the full-size product to use as my daily summer moisturizer.

I has a smooth silicone-like finish so it doubles as a great makeup primer, but it is silicone free. It does not contained oil or fragrance which is great for oily and acne prone skin. This is one of the only face sunscreens that hasn't broken me out. Because of the unique silicone-like texture, a little goes a loooong way, so even though it is on the pricier side for a sunscreen, I feel like it will last me a long time and I am really getting my money's worth. I would recommend this to anyone looking to try a new sunscreen this summer. This has quickly become my holy grail facial sunscreen!",

Throughout the day I see these little white flakes all over and if I touch my face it peels even more into little balls. It has a silicone gel-like texture which never works for my skin. This would be a disaster under foundation. I’m going to try one of their other dispense methods, maybe the mist, to see how it works out because I do like the formula.",

It also causes my tinted moisturizer to feel slippery??? if I try to put it on right after I’ve applied this.\n\nMy biggest concern, however, is the red algae in this product. Red algae is one of THE BIGGEST comedogenic ingredients out there. Basically, it will clog your pores no matter what. It’s also mildly irritating. I have acne prone skin so this product was a huge disappointment because I was so excited when I got this in. Honestly didn’t even use it long enough to see how my skin reacted because I was terrified to find out. I have combination sensitive skin.",

After reading the reviews I decided to give it a chance and boy am I thrilled I did! This stuff is absolutely amazing. It functions great as a primer, doesn't leave a gross, heavy feeling on my face, and it doesn't have an icky smell! I'm honestly so impressed and I'm so happy I don't have to think about putting on sunscreen every day. I am fair-skinned and have never noticed a white film at all and my makeup doesn't matte up at all during the day. Do yourself a favor and give it a try!",

It feels so nice on the skin, doesn’t feel oily/greasy (does feel slippery and different than other creams for sure), doesn’t leave a white cast at all, dries/absorbs quickly and feels almost like a primer on the face once it’s absorbed (which is nice if you plan to apply makeup afterwards), doesn’t have a “sunscreen” smell/fragrance or really any fragrance which I love, and has cleaner ingredients than most chemical sunscreens on the market.

What I really like about it is the high SPF without feeling like an SPF, and it really does work very nicely with a variety of foundation formulas. In fact, it seems to be the most versatile foundation friendly primer I have used. My only little issue I have is I do tend to get a bit shiny with this but it’s not meant to be mattifying and since my skin is normal/combo and not dry that makes sense. It’s not greasy like other SPFs though, so blotting papers work just fine. I may try their matte version when I use up this bottle, but other then the shine it’s a great primer. I use other SPF products too (moisturizer and foundation), so the combination has so far worked really well for sun protection.",

After investing in a series of microderm sessions, my esthetician kindly insisted that I finally start getting serious about consistent sunscreen use. I have finicky skin that is extremely sensitive to new products and tends to break out immediately after deviating from my usual routine. After reading reviews I landed on this product, crossed my fingers, and began applying religiously as part of my morning routine. Fast forward to 9 months later and I don’t know what I’d do if this product was ever discontinued! Not only did my skin remain clear, but the texture of this product left my skin so velvety soft that I now actually prefer the feel of having this sunscreen on! It somehow seems to offer a smoother surface for make-up application, and doesn’t leave any white cast or stickiness that other products notoriously leave behind. 5 stars, only because they won’t let me give 10!",

It goes on smooth w/no residue or oily feeling. I dont wear makeup but it leaves my skin soft and non-greasy when applied OVER my moisturizer. My face is a bit shiny by mid-day BUT I have super oily skin to start with and that's nothing a blotting tissue can't handle. This and the SUPERGOOP moisturizer w/SPF are the only sunscreens that have never caused a breakout for me. I prefer this one for the summer as it is lighter than the moisturizer.

I haven't used Supergoop products before, therefore i had no expectations. Once received, I fell instantly in love with it! It hasn't been easy finding a sunscreen that does not clog up pores, or leave a white cast, or even leave my face feeling sticky. Supergoop was the answer to my prayers. On top of that, it appears to prime my face prior to makeup application. I loved it so much, I purchased the full-sized product prior to the sample version running out. For the price point, it is quite worth it because a little goes a long way and it'll last for awhile. One thing it doesn't do is keep my face matte and devoid of oiliness, but I am not going to hold it against them. I just use other skincare or makeup products to make up for it.

So I usually Put chemical SPF on my hand, oh yeah’ also Supergoop Has another Glow stick SPF which is also great SPF for the back of my hand. Due to the sun exposure, I can see some hyperpigmentation on my hands, that’s why I consider wearing SPF on my hands very serious.  This one is super Translucent, and matte finished. I put the hand cream then this one on the back of my hand. Feels smooth and soft, even forget I have SPF on my hand. Also, very very reasonable price!! I’m going to buy this one for my father, and he never put SPF on his face because of the white lotion like sunscreens. Now I think  I found a right one for him.",

It is so frustrating trying to find a multipurpose product that has an SPF higher than 30 - I prefer to use something like a SPF/BB cream or SPF/moisturizer than having to add another thing to my routine. This is perfect as a finishing step for no makeup days, under powder alone, or as a primer for full face makeup, all with SPF 40. The silky texture and no white cast are also fabulous bonuses.",

I can even use it on my active elementary school-aged kids, and they don't complain about \"sunscreen in their eyes\" when they sweat.  My youngest son even thinks it smells like \"cupcakes.\"  You will not be disappointed in this purchase, but if you're hesitant, Sephora normally has a trial/sample size in their sunscreen collection every year.",

Like, they were actually painful, even natural ones like DE. Though I haven’t given it a full romp in the sun for an effectiveness test, this is the gentlest facial sunscreen I have found for everyday wear. It’s not at all irritating. It hardly seems like sunscreen. It is my new holy grail for face sunscreen, and I have tried many. Thank you Supergoop for a highly functional yet GENTLE product.",

It goes into my skin so well and after letting it set it didn’t have any oiliness. It’s easy to apply, feels light, and is perfect for wearing under makeup or bare faced. It has the perfect balance between light and easy so as not to feel like you’re covered in sunscreen while also letting you feel protected. I burn pretty easily and was not even red after a week in Aruba using this!",

I have a sunscreen sensitivity, I break out into small rashes in the areas the sunscreen is in. This hasn’t done that and it’s been a 2 weeks of everyday use. It hasn’t broke me out, give me a rash, nothing. This was the best recommendation I’ve ever gotten from a Sephora employee and I trust NO ONE in a Sephora uniform lol. The consistency of this feels like a primer (mainly the smash box photo finish or the maybeline baby skin primer) and it feels like butter in the face. It’s translucent with a slight yellow tint. I apply this after my moisturizer everyday, even if there’s no sun out. There’s no type of cast on the skin (and I’m a dark skinned girl) I love that my face still feels hydrated and it has a slight velvet matte finish for a few hours but of course it will start to break down like any other sunscreen out there. A little goes a long way. I love how my skin looks with it on and even after it breaks down.",

How could a sunscreen be THAT perfect? I am amazed. There's no lingering residue, and sometimes I have to REMIND myself that I even have sunscreen on. I've read that lots of people say it works as a primer, but it works just fine UNDER the primer I use. I wish it came in an economy-sized tube, because I will definitely continue to buy!",

The instructions say to use a small amount, which I failed to do and it felt greasy and weird.

But I’m in the midst of a series of laser treatments on the face to get rid of some hyperpigmentation due to sun damage and nothing works on my skin but this! Even things I’ve been using for years are breaking me out right now or completely drying out my face even if the product made me oily before. I really didn’t know what to do, but this sunscreen actually improved my skin tone and texture and my make up went on so nicely. I put on my skin care including moisturizer and let it absorb, then put on this sunscreen and let it dry down, and then makeup. I couldn’t wear any sunscreen, tinted moisturizer or foundation for several hrs. until I found this. I can’t wait until my laser treatments are completed because I have sensitive skin and this no downtime laser is aggressive for me. I’m confident though when my skin goes back to its usual oily combo state, I’ll continue to use this because I know it won’t irritate my skin. Love this stuff!",

I went to Florida last week, (my face hasn't seen the sun in practically six months) so I decided to buy this in hopes that I wouldn't break out like I normally do from drug store face sun screen. This literally cleared my face of any blemishes??!! Yes, i'm sure the sun also helped significantly but I know this played a huge part too. You will not be disappointed. I think with its consistency it will likely work well on all skin types. So pleased! My parents even used my bottle and said the same thing. Definitely give it a try if you're on the fence.",

I have oily skin and by the end of the day I am no more oily than normal when I wear this sunscreen, so I can say with confidence that it does not increase my oiliness.

I use this stuff as my primer or pair it with a pore blurring primer on top and let me tell you, I haven’t had to use oil blotting sheets in weeks! I don’t know what it is but I’m sold on this!

It smells a little bit like silicon. Also I am giving it 4 star because it has Octinoxate which is not good for sea environment. Hopefully they will remove that ingredient soon. I like oxybenzone free because it gives me allergic reaction to it aside from it is bad for the environment. This product does not have that. Hopefully it will be octinoxate free soon as well.",

This has become the favorite part of my makeup routine every day now. It feels like soft clouds caressing my face when applied, drying down to the perfect texture to be worn with or without makeup. I have tried pairing this with three foundations, and have noted that it actually made the foundation stay longer and no added oil by the end of the day. After starting to use this, I get compliments on my skin at work. A little goes a long way. I would say I use about 1/2mL each use (give or take), so with daily use, this bottle would provide 100 applications.",

This does help my makeup last,  but I will say that those like myself with oily skin and large pores will need to blot powder a couple times during the day.  No big deal though,  I don't know of a primer with 30+ spf, clear,  mattifying, smoothing, and long lasting.  So, I still consider this a win!",

After cleansing   toner and serums, I apply my moisturizer and let that sink in, then apply this sunscreen as the final skincare step.

It is a little pricey compared to what's on the market but I really like the texture, finish, and effectiveness of this. Texture is similar to a primer with that silky feeling, and the finish is like a... semi-matte finish. If you're the type to put on face makeup every day, this also works as a primer while keeping you protected from the rays. If you're extremely oily and/or combination, this is a perfect daily sunscreen for you. Makeup products with sunscreen built into it don't work as well (e.g. foundation with SPF) because you actually have to put more on for it to be effective; with this, it's made as a sunscreen and since it's similar to a traditional primer, you can use a generous amount for the sun protection without it feeling too heavy or packing it on like you would if you used a foundation with SPF. Highly recommend!",

It still adds a bit of 'slip' because it doesn't really sink in, just sits on your face. Feels like a primer -- makes your skin super smooth and soft.

I eventually had to just take everything off and start over because I couldn't stand the sensation. As such, I have no idea if it's any good for sunscreen or makeup longevity.",

Luckily, the smell goes away throughout the day. So I am still able to stand it, so I still use it.

I apply on my face alone if I’m applying makeup when the sun is down, and on my ears and neck and even down to my chest for daytime.  My makeup lasts 10hr days with minimal transfer (I sometimes touch my face—I know, bad!) with this as a base, from the high-end Natasha Denona Foundation X (90/92) to the Sephora Bright Future Color Corrector (Orange), the latter which tends to crease and wear off with a crappier primer, but far less so with this Supergoop one.\n\nI score this product 5 stars because it is a high quality primer as well as UV protection, it is splendid for dark skin tones, friendly to my oily skin, plus it withstands the heat and a little sweat.  I blot once or twice in the day (and I do this daily because I am genetically ultra oily everywhere no matter what product I use).

I use to hate putting on sunscreen everyday because they were always so oily and I felt like they just sat on my skin or made my makeup look weird. This is totally different from anything I've tried before. It is kind of hard to see online, but it is a clear gel-like sunscreen, and goes on clear with no white residue that you get from other sunscreens. I also really like that it protects from blue light. All the other blue light protection creams I have found are expensive and I haven't found this in many other sunscreens but think it is also very important in addition to UV protection. I have dealt with acne for a very long time and have not experience any break outs from this. My first bottle from 3 months ago is still going (after almost daily use) and I have already re-ordered my second bottle. I will definitely be using this for a long time, it will be very hard to make me switch from this!",

Well, this one is also good but..., BUT (hahaha) for very different reasons. First the love part. OMG, you put this stuff on and you neither see it nor feel it 60 seconds later. I have no clue what it is made of but I think of a silicone based product when I use it. There is no wet feeling at all when you put it on. No irritating smell. NO detrimental effects on your make up. No breakouts (for me anyway). I couldn't convey any stronger how much I love this product if they paid me millions to do so. \n\nNow, on to the but... Really? Does it really have to be this expensive? If you use facial sunscreen, you pretty much have to use it daily. That's a high price tag for a product you have to use daily. From what I understand, you have to put a good amount of any sunscreen on in order to obtain the benefits of the SPF level in the product. So if you're just barely putting this on to make it last longer, you're getting a beautiful, weightless, makeup friendly, SPF 15 :(  But for those of you who are willing to pay that ridiculous price tag (like me unfortunately), this is the ONLY sunscreen to put on your face.

I would say that it does the job as far as a transparent SPF protection that doesn't irritate my skin. The texture of the Supergoop is more powdery whereas Murad is more silky. That doesn't really bother me, however. The only thing I think Murad does much better is the smoothing effect. My skin stays much less shiny using the Murad with no other make up. However, for almost half the price, I have absolutely no complaints about the Unseen Sunscreen!",

Several people remarked on it. It's a team player, working with other products in my arsenal to help me achieve my goal of great-looking skin. \n\nSo why am I not giving it the 5 stars? The price. I don't think it should be at the price point that it is given the amount it offers. I think it should have a little more product at $32.00 Even so, I'm still going to buy it again because it's just that good.",

I have combination skin and usually have to blot my face once a day even with the best possible primer (hourglass veil, in case you wonder). This sunscreen has no smell and really goes on like a primer. I found it layers with makeup beautifully. I still need to blot by face in the middle of the day, but that's OK for me. No breakouts, no makeup melting, no foundation/BB cream pilling. It really makes daily sunscreen use became part of your routine. Worth every penny. I think it's similar to MURAD invisiblur, but it is more smooth and easier to layer with makeup. For no make up days, I still stick with COOLA mineral, since it has a bit of color.",

I've seen sunscreen before that has claimed not to leave any white chalky residue, but it always does.\n\nI decided to give this one a try, in part because I'm going on vacation shortly, and also because I know I need to use it. The reviews made me decide to take a chance on this one, and wow am I glad I did. THIS STUFF COMES OUT OF THE TUBE TRANSLUCENT, Y'ALL. There is no white-blue glow because this product is colorless! I've fund the holy grail of facial sunblock. I went to buy another tube of this two days after I received it, and it was already sold out.

        "review_text": "I’m starting to realize how important sunscreen is. And I think a lot of people ignore it especially when they’re younger. This sunscreen makes me want to wear it because the packaging is so cute and the concept is great. I’ve been seeing a lot of clear sunscreens popping up in the skincare industry lately but hadn’t tried one. I saw this one in Sephora one day and thought I’d give it a try. I love that it’s clear so that there’s no white cast so this would be great for darker skin tones. When I first put it on, I was surprised by a scent that I thought was silicone. I read the ingredients and sure enough it has some in there. This is good and bad because on one hand it can double as a primer for makeup and leave a smooth oil-free surface. But on the other hand, it can trap in dirt or oil and clog pores. Overall, I’m really excited about this product and I’m glad protecting my skin from the sun this summer will be a lot more pleasant of a process.",

I wouldn't consider this sunscreen heavy-duty, but it is SPF 40 and wears beautifully under makeup or on a bare face. MOST IMPORTANTLY, it leaves no white cast! So this is complexion-friendly for absolutely every skin tone! I bought this when it first released months ago, and I haven't gone through it quite as quickly as the Drunk Elephant. Perhaps it's because I'm subconsciously saving it? It's just that reliable and unique of a product. There is literally no other sunscreen on the market like it.",

Not only is it nongreasy, I honestly can’t feel it at all after I apply.

The smell is pleasant too, almost undetectable. I have very fair, sensitive, dry skin. I put this on over my moisturizer and under any makeup. Supergoop’s Everday Sunscreen was too oily for my skin.

I even gifted this to a  friend for her newborn because of how smoothly and quickly the sunscreen glides on. And because it doesn't have lots of nasty gunk in it and is also fragrance free, she was super happy with it, too! No struggling with baby to try to smooth out that unsightly whitecast from typical sunscreens or to apply it despite harsh smells from aerosol versions!

The product is a gel (not a lotion), and when I put it on it literally disappears into my skin.  Zero wait time to put on makeup afterwards, and my skin feels exactly the same as it did before the sunscreen.

Down here in the tropics, where it’s always hot and sunny, Sunscreen is a must.",

I have very dry sensitive red skin. Because I have rosacea, it is a necessity for me to put sunscreen on every morning. I had been using the Cera Ve sunscreen (which is terrible don't use it). It was thick and it looked terrible under makeup. Plus it gave me the worst white cast and I'm already very white. This does the EXACT opposite. It is completely clear so no cast. That alone is worth the money. ON TOP OF THAT, it is hands down one of the best makeup primers I've used. It has a consistency a lot like Photofinish primer. But better! In my opinion, it sinks into the skin quicker and better than the Smashbox one. Even without makeup your pores look so much smaller and your face feels BABY SOFT. I highly recommend this to all my rosacea girls out there and anyone who is looking for a good spf under their makeup!",

A little goes a long way, there's little to no scent when you first apply, it doesn't give you a white greasy cast, and best of all it helps with the oil production on my face! The only draw back that can be fixed is it does a have a tendency to pill, but only if you put it on immediately after applying moisturizer or foundation. If you give it a minute or two to settle in the skin it does not do that. You can't go wrong with this sunscreen, its very light on the face and easy to apply!

Whether it actually acts as a primer, I couldn't care less. I actually look forward to this as a final step to my skincare. I go through my entire day thinking constantly about how I DON'T FEEL IT. I wish I had one of those UV Lamps so I could prove to myself I was getting spf 40 coverage. It's literally that invisible and weightless. \n\nThis sunscreen is incredible. It's honestly revolutionary in my eyes. I know, without a doubt, that this has changed the game of remembering / willing myself to apply sunblock every day completely. I know I'll put it on every day. There's no longer sacrifice, only benefit. \n\nI'm calling it now that this will be the new standard in sunblocks, that soon we will see a wave of every other sunblock manufacturer trying to achieve the same primer-like texture and weightless feel. Good. We're entering a new era of sunblock ladies, we've come a long, long weigh from the first release of Neutrogena Helioplex that I think we can all remember, and had already thought 'oh it can't get better than this'. \n\nThank you supergoop.

When I came across this I was so excited to try it! I LOVE IT! The texture is incredible (feels just like the Smashbox photo finish primer) and it’s not greasy! It didn’t irritate my sensitive skin and I had zero breakouts from it! It absorbs very quickly so it’s easy to include as part of your morning routine underneath makeup or just on its own after moisturizer. I use it as an SPF and still use a primer with makeup but I am curious to start using it as a primer and see if my makeup will last longer because that would cut a step out of my makeup rountine and it would make this product even more incredible!",

It?s totally personal preference. Smashbox makes amazing primers. I always have both on hand in case I?m doing makeup for the evening or if a certain foundation needs it, or if I want to be sure my makeup really stays put. A lot of SPF?s are considered good as primers, basically for the soft and smooth finish they leave due to the high amounts of all sorts of dimethicone (which is a silicone) ingredients which are also found in a lot of primers. Compare the ingredients on INCI. It will let you do a side by side comparison",

You should also wait the dermatologist recommended 8 minutes (or more, depending on how heavy your moisturizer is) after applying moisturizer to let it sink in, before applying sunscreen. Sunscreen is considered the very last step of your skincare routine, and primer is the first step of makeup. This product combines sunscreen and primer into one step, so just apply after your moisturizer has absorbed. In my experience, this also keeps the pilling issue some reviewers have mentioned from happening.",

(This is important not just to prevent pilling, but because applying chemical sunscreen on top of another product that has not fully absorbed interferes with the chemical film the sunscreen needs to form on your skin to work effectively and protect you.) #2 When the sunscreen is on your fingers, tap it in dots over the main points of your face using one finger ?cheeks, chin, forehead, etc. From there, use all of your fingers to pat it in like you would a toner or serum. Only after this should you then use a rubbing motion to move it to any places you didn?t fully cover with the patting. This minimizes the physical action and friction of spreading it and prevents pilling.",

It just pills off and also pills off my makeup over it. I think its gorgeous but I'm going to try wearing it a different way, maybe it doesn't mix well with my primer or maybe i should try it over my foundation. I bought this because I LOVE the concept, I had gotten the Kosas Glow IV but it gave me a terrible allergic reaction, which is sooo strange because I have pretty much every type of skincare/makeup under the sun and nothing usually bothers me. But then again, the Kosas foundation gave me the same issue so it must be something in those 2 products. Anyways, no bad reaction to this and it looks gorgeous. I love the glitteryness that is not quite actual glitter but just gorgeous highlight that isn't too intense or funky looking. It looks cute on its own without foundation or anything else. Makes you look so ethereal, dewy, and gorgeous. ALSO THE BEST PART about this cute product is the size for the money... it's actually super big for the cost. I will for sure be buying more from this brand.",

SUPERRRR GLOWYYY - made my skin so so so so soooooo glowy!!!\n2. Did make my skin rlly red. - Without any produnct on, my skin is a little red. I've developed a pretty good skincare routine to get rid of it and this product almost completly reversed it. The redness does fade after awhile tho. I use concealer, bronzer and blush for my base with nothing on my forehead and once I was finished my base, the redness was completely gone. \n3. Doesn't tan skin too too well - one of the main reasons I bought this product was to \"warm up\" my face, but it didn't deliver too well. I put on as much product as I do for any other \"tanning\" solution and not much changed. I recomend using half a pump. (one pump id rlly big).\n4. HUGE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT - I bought this about 3-4 months ago and I use half a pump everyday.

When I run out, it will be missed on my vanity although Lumi kinda does similar.....so will I? Meh. \n\nIf this isn't a big deal for you then by all means, it is a beautiful product. I will use it as a primer alone, mix it into my lighter foundations to deepen the color and add more of a glow, and also mix with other primers to fix different issues all-in-one.",

I put some on the back of my hand and the smell was so strong and awful. I washed my hands and it still haunted me for a couple hours. I also didn’t see any real glow or difference in the back of my hand. You can get something way better for way cheaper at the drugstore. Immediately returned.",

It gives the perfect amount of glow to dull skin, not the amount that would make you look like a tin man…I like how it makes your face look nice and dewy. The only trouble I have with this product is that the packaging is bad. I like the nice glass bottle but the weird bag inside of it is really strange, plus the cheap plastic top is constantly falling off in my makeup bag. Overall, I like this a lot and I think it is pretty worth it for the price.",

I've tried Haus Labs, it was okay but too thick for me and kind of patchy. Then purchased the Armani, I had high hopes for this because it felt so light and serum-like, but this foundation oxidizes badly on me plus, it does not stay long! So, again, I bought the Dior- this one a tad bit better than the first two, BUT it oxidizes a bit and at the end of the day, some parts of my face get patchy. Imagine my disappointment because, I have shelled out too much money. Then I decided to purchase THIS and it's really a game charger! When I say skin, I meant like that glass-skin airbrush Kardashian edited finish! What I do is I mix it with my foundation and skin tint and this has magically solved all of problems! For some reason it makes my foundation feels lighter on my skin! And it makes them last longer. No more oxidation and patchiness. ONE THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS IS THAT SAIE IS SO GOOD IT MAKES ME SO PHOTOGENIC THAT I COULD'T EVEN POST IT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'll BE CATFISHING EVERYONE LOL!",

I have tried it on top of powder and everything, and even though it is a very liquidy formula, it never disturbs my makeup underneath! I just lightly dab it with my finger. Even though I do like a blinding powder highlight, I have been stepping away from that and looking for things that look more naturally radiant. This will still give you that pop and have your face catching the light without the look of powder sitting on top of your skin or chunky glitter.",

I also like that it has nice ingredients like squalane and vitamin C.

I got contact dermatitis after using this. Adding \"Clean at Sephora\" when a product is not actually clean is pretty deceiving to say the least. Not suited for sensitive skin if you're anything like me and are sensitive to any irritants such as acrylates. Really loved Saie until this. :/",

I barely had purging if any at all. I have acne prone \nAnd since starting this product I haven’t had a new breakout. The smell isn’t sweet or anything I don’t mind it but it definitely isn’t the best. Overall I love how shiny and fresh this makes my skin. From buying the Katie wang skincare routine I spent around 450$ in total and none of it was sponsored or discounted, so trust me when I say, the money spent was well worth it my skin was in desperate need of hydration.

Another difference between the drunk elephant bronzi drops and these is that the saie sunglow is a lot thicker like it’s own cream and it felt quite heavy on my face so if you were going to buy this as a dupe for the drunk elephant drops I would recommend just splurging on the actual drunk elephant drops. One thing I do really like about these is that you can mix these drops with your foundation to make it a little darker if necessary and gives more of a glow.",

I have a weird patch of acne on my cheek right now (from before I started using this, don't worry.) and this doesn't accentuate the texture of it. It doesn't look greasy, either- just healthy. I really don't know how else to describe it. But at the same time, it's not going to be so much of a highlighter that you'll look like a human diamond or anything. You could probably build it up and focus the product on more precise spots on the face for a more blinding look. If you're on the fence, I'd say go for it. The one aspect of it that did catch me offguard was the scent. It doesn't smell like it's got harsh fragrances or anything but it does happen to smell like bread to me.

After trying it out, I was hooked, so I bought the full size! I love a dewy, glowy look, and this gives just that. I've even gotten compliments on how radiant my complexion looks when I apply it. I was worried I would shine a little too much like the Teletubbies sun baby, but it's kinda hard to overdo it since the shimmer is pretty subtle when you mix it with moisturizer or SPF. It's also nice to dab a little on my cheekbones and nose for some extra glow. I have a super fair skin tone and this helps me look less like the ghost of a victorian child. I have acne prone skin and this has not yet caused me any issues. Over all, it's a super fun product that has made its way into my daily routine!",

My skin is mostly dry/combo, mostly on the dry side because I use Tret at night so skin prep in the morning is REALLY important regardless of what makeup or coverage I'm going for. I first apply my Vitamin C, then sunscreen, then I apply my HADA LABO Gokujyun Hyaluronic Acid Premium Lotion and then my Eucerin Complete Repair cream as moisturizer which is the only thing that has been enough to handle my Tret skin. After all of this, I apply the Glowy Super Gel all over my face (even if I'm not wearing foundation - when I do wear foundation I opt for light to medium skin tints on top of this). I'm already looking hydrated and dewy with all my skin prep but this product give me a glow to add on top of the glass/wet/dewy look my face already has at this point. I set my face with the Charlotte Tilbury setting, always, regardless of what coverage I went for that day. The spray does not take away the glow at all and it does make it last longer in my opinion.",

I also use it by itself just under my eyebrows. The mini size container is plastic but the standard size one is glass (which I've already dropped and broken). The standard size one has the product in a thick plastic-like bag inside the glass container (thank goodness!); the mini size uses a disc to push the product upwards as the pump is pressed. Both packaging methods mean that you use every drop - no wasted highlighter! This product definitely has a permanent place on my makeup tray.",

It makes you look glowing and like you just put all your serums onto the most perfect version of your skin. I frequently use this when I'm doing errands on my day off to look a little bit better. My tip is putting some on your bone right below your eyebrow to look extra awake. My major con with this product is that it really isn't made for full-coverage makeup looks. Makes sense for Saie though, can't really be too mad as a full-coverage glam isn't really their thing as a brand. It just dooooesn't sit well at all with powders or high-coverage foundations.\n\nIf you're wiling to accept this product for what it is, its amazing. However, I wouldn't buy it if you're looking for the most versatile highlighter that will suit all looks. Just know what you're getting into before you buy!",

I'm Indian, so I was worried about the Starglow being too light. Both shades blend out to clear, so I can honestly use either shade. But I think the Sunglow looks just a little bit better under my foundation. This can also be worn without foundation. I used it with just some concealer while working from home today, and when I was on a call with a coworker, she immediately told me that I looked great and that I looked like I was glowing. My only recommendation is to avoid putting it under your eyes. When I put concealer over it under my eyes, I got a grey cast.",

I wanted to see how “universal” It truly was. I’ll say on my light/medium skin tone I can easily wear both shades. There’s no true glitter or sparkle that disrupts or distracts from other makeup products over top. This product is more of a dewey glow that has the lit- from-within glow. I personally use it as a primer to add a subtle tackiness & sheen underneath my skin tints. Use in the high points of the face over top your foundation for a soft dewey highlight. Bridge of nose, cheek bones, temples and cupids bow are my favorite areas for an eye catching glow. Non irritating, not slippery, & not highly pigmented. Just a soft ray of light. Beginner friendly for sure! Highly recommend this Brand for skin lovers and soft glam beauty.",

The gold shimmer isn't too subtle, so it can definitely be worn under foundation to add luminance to the skin. Price wise, I think $28 is quite reasonable for the amount of product you receive and the quality of the refillable glass bottle. I have repurchased this clean beauty product numerous times and will continue to do so! Definitely worth it.",

I got this in a Sephora 2022 holiday set, and I thought I got an expired product until I saw other people here comment on the smell.

It's versatile (mix a pump into face cream and wear it all over for a glow and extra boost of hydration, layer it as a primer, and/or apply on top of makeup like any other highlighter). Goes on light and smooth, blends easily, and feels soothing on the skin. The glow is long-lasting, without big chunks of glitter, and skin feels extra hydrated. So many highlighters feel drying or tight on the skin but this doesn't. The most second skin-like effect of any highlighter I've tried! I appreciate that aspect most of all, especially as I get older. I'm on my third bottle. The glass bottle is recyclable btw, just remove the interior bag!",

I rated 4 out of 5 stars because of the smell. The smell is nice but it is strong in my opinion. By the end of the day I can still smell it on my face which isn't my favorite. I will continue wearing because it is THAT good but future versions would be improved with a more subtle scent.",

        "review_text": "Recently I was given a change to try out Saie’s Glowy Super Gel Lightweight Dewy Highlighter in both shades, Starglow and Sunglow. I really like the packaging, a pump bottle that allows you to adjust the amount of product you press out from the container. A little going a long way, I appreciate having a lot of control with how much highlighter I can expel as to not waste product.\n\nI enjoy the sheer luminous finish this product offers without it feeling heavy of sticky on my skin and dries down nicely without sliding all over my face, allowing me to be selective in my placement. Both shades are quite wearable, Starglow is a champagne shade that I think would look good on most skin tones were as Sunglow is a slightly darker and warmer bronze shade. Both of these shades contain microfine glitter particles, yet I think I see more glitter in the Sunglow shade. In general I am not a huge glitter fan but these pieces are very fine and do not feel chunky or scratchy on my sensitive skin and although noticeable on a swatch test, the actual glitter particles are harder to see on my face allowing for the highlighter to look natural after a light application to something much more glamorous with a heavier hand. \n\nIt is worth noting that I consider myself scent sensitive and although this product is not without a fragrance, it reminds me of lilac much like the Kosas products do. The scent does linger as I can still smell it on the back of my hand where I applied even after washing, but it is not over powering and not a deal breaker as I don't smell it on my face once applied.\n\nI admire the versatility of this highlighter and I want to continue exploring how this will work as a primer as well as mixed into my other cream products. I have used it over cream eyeshadow without creasing and I am happy to say that this highlighter does not make my texture or pores more pronounced, nor does it irritate my dry sensitive skin making this a product I will continue to reach for.",

I have to say, I like this more than I have ever liked Flawless Filter. This has the lightest feeling on the skin, almost like a serum, and just gives the prettiest glow. I have started using it multiple ways depending on what I am going for - under foundation to give my skin a glowy undertone, mixed into foundation to sheer it out and add a luminosity to it, as a light highlight, over concealer to even out my skin on light makeup days - all of it looks so good. This layers so well under foundation because it is so thin, so it never feels like I am caking on heavy layer after heavy later, and it doesn't disrupt any products I apply it over. This is honestly such a beautiful product, and you can not beat the price in comparison to other products like this on the market right now.",

        "review_text": "(I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review.  All opinions my own.)\n\nI opted to try this because I love a dewy, glowy makeup look.  Short take is: it's quite pretty, though it gives a subtler look that could probably be achieved with other products too.  \n\nThe packaging is nice, I like the glass bottle, pump, and that it's big enough to use on the body too (which I think would look beautiful).  It has a thin, lightweight texture that feels wet and thin on the skin, but it has enough body to not be super watery.  I apply it all over the face on bare skin (see photo) and then apply makeup on top - It has layered well with all the makeup I've tried so far\n\nIt feels almost like light skincare when applied, absorbing into the skin to leave a light wash of pearly shine that makes the skin look luminous.  The particles are small enough that you don't look doused in glitter/shimmer, which I appreciate.  However, it can be quite subtle if not in direct light, so I wouldn't use it as a highlighter over makeup (too wet, not noticeable enough).  I like the way it feels and could see pinpointing it on your high points to use as a very subtle \"highlight\" if you're not wearing makeup that day - since it's so light, it doesn't have a makeupy look on the skin and wouldn't stand out texturally on bare skin.\n\nOverall, I think it's a very pretty product, but definitely niche - best for people who want a slight glow and prefer lighter makeup!  Also, I've tried both shades and Sunglow, though deeper looking, is sheer enough to work on almost all skin tones.  Both are veeery lightly pigmented (basically an unnoticeable base carrying small luminous particles)",

It just give that slightly younger luminescent skin. Not too glowy which is a good thing for me. I wouldn’t even count this as a highlighter. It feels nice and is not tacky. The pro to this product over hourglass is it has some skin care ingredients. Hourglass powders last forever so I will have to see how long this lasts to decide if I would repurchase. I deducted a star because it’s not a “game changer/holy grail” product for me personally. I’ve been using it a month now and I like it.",

I have a fair complexion and so I was a little nervous this might look like dirt on my face, but it doesn’t! It provides such a natural looking glow and is perfect for summertime when you have a tan. It’s very natural and doesn’t have any sparkles or glitters either, so it just makes for the perfect base product for a no-makeup makeup day! I wear this on it’s own and I love it. Will be getting the lighter shade for wintertime!",

I would mix it with my spf30 and apply to my face after a shower, and then apply 1 extra pump over my spf. I have VERY oily, acne-prone skin and this product made my skin look beautiful and natural. Usually when I wear foundation with primer and setting powder, my skin would be an oil slick hours later. But somehow, this highlighter alone mixed with spf would keep my face looking glowy and hydrated without any oiliness by the end of the day. Unfortunately the 1 dealbreaker with this product is that everyone around me kept saying I smell like beer after using this. I had bought several new products with this one and it took me a week to isolate the cause and find out that this 1 product was the culprit for the smell. Somehow I didn’t smell it but everyone else did. I always use this after I shower in the morning and I tried spraying perfume but the beer stench still lingered from this product, so I had to stop using it completely.

I also really like that the shimmer from this product is not obnoxious like other highlighters, so it can be worn daily and in a business professional setting.

I did give it two stars because typically things like this will cause my sensitive skin to have a bad reaction and I had absolutely no reaction to it at all. So if you have sensitive skin, I would recommend going to try this on in the store and see if the color works for you because then you will enjoy the product and won’t have a reaction.",

It goes on very sheer and weightless, feels like nothing. It's lovely if i want to not look like I'm noticeably wearing anything, but still want a bit of glow. It's probably not a noticeable enough highlight for some folks, but for my casual daily makeup look it's perfect. I left off one star because the sickly sweet fragrance of it is so strong and sometimes i get tiny pimples right where i applied it. \n \nI would love a version that doesn't smell like flowery perfume.",

I’d recommend for someone with dry, dull, and sensitive skin for a subtle natural looking glow.",

I totally understand why this product works incredibly for lighter skin tones but I had to use 2-3 pumps just to see a glow, and at that point it just felt too heavy. For reference I tested the product as a highlighter, and an all over “primer”.",

Luminizer is a good description for it.\n\nCons: It seemed to accentuate my large pores. The Starglow color nearly matches my skin and made me look perhaps dewy, but pale and without warmth. I was also a little bit surprised that I could see particles in the product-- I guess these were mica. I feel like the stock photos depict a smooth gel with no particles, so this was surprising and makes me less likely to wear on the regular.",

But it's like a super thin shimmery moisturizer instead.\nI don't trust positive reviews anymore. Everyone was given the product for free or they were paid or they work for the company. Click verified purchases only and 90% of the reviews disappear. \nI was expecting something more like charlotte tilbury liquid highlighter in the tube, I guess?\n\nBut when I applied this like I would with actual highlighter it just blended out to nothing. I put it on the top of my cheekbones and i could barely see it. I just kind of looked sweaty?  I don't get it the appeal. \nYou get a ton of product for the price I guess considering youre not gonna use this like foundation, you're supposed to mix it into stuff. But I dont want or need shimmer all over my whole entire face, so I'm not mixing it into anything. I use targeted precise highlighter only. \nIt thins out and spreads easily over your skin, like a very light weight moisturizer, and dries down fast. But it's almost like you put nothing on at all. And the shade is like almost my actual skin tone, maybe darker, so it just doesnt make sense for me personally.\n\nMaybe this would work for someone who has dry skin, wants tons of all over iridescence, and has medium to tan skin.  I'm N0-5 and this just doesn't \"highlight\" me.\nImo, it shouldnt be marketed as a highlighter, they should just call it a luminating primer. I can see how this is almost a dupe for the hollywood flawless filter by charlotte tilbury(tons more shades), and I hated that too, but at least the marketing for that was clear. It's like a subtle shimmer filter.  After an hour I literally couldnt see it anymore, the tiny amount of other makeup must have covered it up.\nI am over these hyped up products that dont do anything.",

This is a great product, but it depends on what you are looking for. I have been using this for about 3 months now, and after testing it multiple different ways I have found the way I like using it best. I am a highlighter girl, so I like my highlight to show up, but I would say this product isn't necessarily a traditional highlighter. It looks best (for me) when I mix it in with my moisturizer and/or liquid foundation. This is more of an all-over-glow instead of a highlighter. I can see where other people are coming from in the sense they thought this was a shoddy highlighter, because I actually don't like it for that purpose either. It doesn't really show up too much. If you are a very natural highlight type of person, then you might like using this product as your only highlight, but I like it as a glowy mix-in to use with my foundation. I love the beautiful, slightly dewy glow it gives me, and my skin doesn't look oily or glittery, just fresh and vibrant. I still use a powder highlighter to give me the strobe effect I like. I gave this 5 stars because the product lives up to its claims and doesn't make my skin look shiny or break me out. I will purchase this product with my own money when I run out.",

        "review_text": "This product is the most effective but still natural/‘no-makeup’ highlighter I’ve ever tried. I’d say the closest product comparison for how to use this would be the Charlotte tilbury Hollywood flawless filter. It can be worn alone all over the face, as a primer or mixed with foundation, as a subtle glow over foundation or just on naked skin. It’s super pretty as it doesn’t have an insane amount of shimmer, but somehow doesn’t look sparse or chunky/glittery. It just makes skin look like it has a bit more plump and glow to it. If you want a blinding liquid highlighter, this is not the product for you. If you want a more multi-purpose product that can do some multitasking for an easier or quicker makeup routine, to look more natural, to be used in a less product-heavy routine, or whatever else along those lines, this is something you should definitely try. I got to know this product by using it a few different ways on a few different occasions when I just had a sample of it, and I loved it so much I bought the full size. A tiny bit goes a long way, so one bottle could last you a very long time. It’s so nice and subtle I’ve mixed it with some lotion and put all over my collarbone/décolletage to get a nice glow over my tan. It’s really nice! For what the product is and what I use it for, I really really enjoy it.",

However, I will review this product and all other products in the package in an unbiased way to the best of my ability.\n\nWhen I first opened this product and swatched it, it really reminded me of Glossier's Futuredew, which is advertised as an \"oil serum hybrid\". The two products are very similar in that they're both serum-like products that provide a sort of glow all over your face. They're also extremely similar in price; the Saie highlighter is $25 for 1oz., and Glossier's Futuredew is $28 for 1oz. (but it's significantly cheaper if you buy it in a set with other products, or if you buy it during their Black Friday sale!). \n\nHowever, there are a couple differences between the two products that make me like Glossier's Futuredew slightly more. While both products provide a highlighted look for the face, this product is more of a glittery shimmer, whereas Futuredew is more natural, with a glowy sheen. Also, since Futuredew is an actual serum for skincare, it's super moisturizing as well, which is just an added bonus for me, since my skin is dry. But if you have oily skin, I'd actually recommend this product over Futuredew, since your skin probably doesn't need all the added moisturizer of Futuredew!\n\nAnother thing about this product is that it smells like pollen, which sounds strange, but when I had my friend smell it, she agreed with me. Since it's a clean beauty product, there's no added fragrance in it, so it must be coming from something natural in the formulation. If you're fine with that, then go for it! \n\nIn conclusion, I think that this highlighter is a really great moderately priced option for someone that wants a sort of natural-looking glittery sheen all over your face - especially someone with oilier skin that wants a liquid highlighter, since often times, liquid highlighters can break people out with oily skin.",

I’ve tried more highlighters than I’d like to admit - liquid, powder, gel, cream....and this is it. This is the one I use daily. And a little goes a long way- I got 2 of the 50ml samples and used them daily on my entire face for over 2 months before they ran out and I had to buy the full size immediately because this is definitely a must have every day product for me. I’m pretty pale, usually like a fair-light in foundation shades and starglow is perfect but it seems it’d be flattering on a pretty wide range of skin tones since it doesn’t really have much color to it, it’s just a sheen. It’s not glittery either, it’s honestly perfect. I can’t say enough good things about it.",

It does have quite a strong smell to it, but I didn't have any reactions to it with my sensitive skin. I really approve of the clean ingredients used in this line and find it is worth every penny. It will be an addition to my daily morning routine from this point forward. A small pump is all that is needed if you're going for light coverage. The pump does like to dispense a large amount at a time, in my opinion, so be careful to press it lightly if you don't want too much.

I've been searching for a liquid highlighter that is easy to apply, stays on my face, and doesn't require scientific precision on my part to avoid looking like I bathed in glitter. \n\nThis is that highlighter.\n\nI use this daily, regardless of whether I use ANY other makeup. It works equally well on its own or mixed with foundation, and gives my skin a nice glow all day without looking or feeling greasy. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it is pretty subtle. It's perfect if you want more of a \"healthy glow\" than a high shine. \n\nFor a novice like me, this is truly the holy grail of no-makeup makeup. If this product is every discontinued, I will personally drive to company headquarters and petition outside until they agree to make it again.",

This is veryyyy dewy and works better as skin illuminator for under foundation than I’d say a topical highlighter. The formula is still super nice, but on top of a full face it separates foundation a bit and looks kind of muddy. If u want a glow under ur foundation or just to combine w moisturizer it will do wonders! I still use it super frequently and do enjoy it on days where I’m not wearing a full face!

I mean, I had an idea, but with my past history of not being a fan of gel or liquid highlighters, I was a bit apprehensive. But, my mind was soon changed once I managed to squeeze a drop on the back of my hand and see it for myself. It’s my new favorite instant glow product that turns anything into a glowy, dewy, illuminating product. It’s super lightweight and once you begin blending it in, it turns into what is best described as a water serum. The liquid absorbs quickly but it’s not greasy/oily nor leaves any film. The shimmer it leaves behind is gorgeous and the gel part adds that hydration dewy look: best of both worlds. It has a scent of flowers, which is lovely. And this works with so many different products: moisturizer, primer, foundation, etc. I never thought I’d love a liquid/gel highlight, but it’s one of my new favorite products so far this year. And Saie in general is one of my top new favorite brands I’ve tried this year. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a lot from within glow or loves good for your skin makeup. A fantastic product, I can’t stop raving about it.",

A dot on the tip of my nose is still there after I take off my doggone covid mask that was glued to my face for an hour. It is just the right amount of highlight without glitter so I don't look like I just finished a concert with Jem and The Holograms.\nI have the mini in my makeup bag now.

I got this as a sample and then ended up purchasing the full size because I found myself wearing it everyday and I couldn’t believe the compliments I was getting. Everyone thought the glow was amazing and ive recommended this to so many people, even my mom is wearing it now! It feels so refreshing as a final step in the skincare. It primes your skin so you don’t need foundation! I used to use future dew by glossier but I found it would irritate me and leave red bumps but I loved the look. This one is way better! No irritating, it’s got minimal ingredients and ingredients that do wonders for the skin! Love love love! This I anticipate being a life long product for me. Amazing. Just amazing!

When I first tried this, my skin was irritated and dry. At the time, I blamed it on the highlighter when it was mixed into my sunscreen. Now that I have used it on healthier skin,  I like it as an overall highlighter. I paired this with Biossance SPF 30, and instead of a slight white cast when I applied too much SPF, it made me look glowy. I like the fact that I don't have to try too hard or need a brush. It's a quick application with my fingers before my sunscreen. However, it does not work as a highlighter on my oily eyelids. It looks like a milky tear drop when I apply in the inner corner. It works great on the bridge of my nose. For the 1st time I get to see an elongation of nose!  I am not sure if I were to repurchase this, but it was a lovely product to try out. Thanks TeamBIC!

I will say I’ve tried both shades and starglow is far more glowy and illuminating than the bronze shade.

I honestly didn’t think I was gonna like anything from this brand bc eventhough they have glowing website reviews, youtubers have had a different experience. So I first got starglow as a free sample and it was...ok. Pretty underwhelming. It’s like if you took Charlotte tilbury flawless filter...and watered it completely down to barely any glow, and no dewy finish. \nHowever, I’m a fan of drunk elephants dibronzi drops for summer, but sometimes the finish is a little oily for me..so I thought I’d take a long shot and try the sunglow color in this as a more natural/satin finish version of dibronzi. And I’m actually impressed! It has a very similar shade (browned bronze - not too copper or orange) but much sheerer and dries down more. I think i might stick with this one instead of the drunk elephant. \n\nSo pale girls looking for a little all over summer glow without looking too dewy or oily - try this! It made my skin look super healthy and radiant without being an oil slick!",

It has a blurring effect on my pores which I never got from an illuminating primer before. Anything I put on top looks much better.

It truly gives a lit from within glow, makes my face look bright and healthy but not greasy or sparkly. Now I know it says it's made of 75% water, but the skincare ingredients they've added (vit c, rosehip oil, etc) actually really help keep my skin happy, smooth and hydrated all day! I've been wearing this for weeks now and have had zero breakouts or irritation. I consider this as much a skincare step as a makeup step, and wow the price is great, I will definitely be repurchasing. The pump is a little finicky as others have mentioned, and I haven't worn it just on its own or mixed with foundation, but for me, mixed with my moisturizer it works great.",

It does have noticeable fragrance but it did not annoy me. \nI don’t think I could make it work as just “highlighter” (on cheekbones, nose bridge, etc.) as it’s very fluid and very very light intensity.

I definitely would not have picked up on my own, but I am so happy I got to test this, because it is a new holy grail. For me, this product has three purposes: 1. As a dewy, all over base product. This is my least favorite way to use, but it does provide a nice layer of dew and shimmer (if using a light coverage on top). 2. As a highlight. It is lovely, easy to smooth and apply, and is super natural in terms of shade, not icy at all. It does not pick up any of the makeup underneath. It applies well with both a finger and synthetic brush. For both, it is super impactful in the sun. 3. My favorite way to use it is to mix it in with difficult to work foundations. I use it by mixing it with non oil based foundations that are too dry or too thick, and it just makes them so much easier to apply, while also sheering out coverage just a tiny bit. It has made my panning of difficult foundations so much easier. I already want a back up.",

You only need a bit, so it will last forever. The formulation is very light since it’s more than 75% water, so it won’t clog your pores or cause breakouts. It also makes makeup you wear after adhere better. The key is that it looks completely natural and dewy, not glittery or artificial. Since it’s a clean product, it’s an added bonus to not have to worry about harmful ingredients and I love how Saie makes it super easy to recycle.

Then I adored the ingredients inside, this product not only decorates you but also takes care about your skin in long term. Finally, the highlight effect is luxurious, soft enough to use on your whole face under your foundation for boosting the overall glow of your skin, and delicate enough to accent your cheekbones as a final step of your make up. I used both ways though prefer for the whole face because of its benefits for skin's health. But I take one star away for because of the smell. It is not strong but is very unpleasant for me. I could not use it for more than a week so much I could not tolerate the smell. So, make sure you try it first before committing to buy, you might like or not its scent. I regretfully cannot use it, will try again later, may be something will change. Got it for free for a review.",

The formula is so easy to mix with other makeup products. It is the most silkiest and softest Highlighter I have tried.

Every step is crucial and has its benefit). \nThis highlighter is to die for. I have always used YSL highlighter which are expensive. But this on the other hand doesn’t break your bank account!!

With the dry winter season, I’ve been used to seeing my skin dry/flaky so this was a very welcomed change. It maintained the dewiness throughout the day too. It’s interesting to note that when I swatched the illuminator on my arm, in daylight it looks like a pearlescent film, but once brought into sunlight, you can really see the super fine sparkles. The sparkles weren’t noticeable on the face with the foundation mix, but rather translated into a smooth look. For my second try-on, I wore Starglow mixed with my foundation only on half of my face and just foundation on the other half to see if I could make out the difference. Starglow is applied on the right side of the photo attached (side with my beauty mark) and there’s a a bit more radiance on that side, particularly on the cheek. This also has a pleasant scent that I’m guessing is either the Papaya Seed Oil or Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, since it doesn’t smell like Rosehip oil to me. The finished result reminds me of the Josie illuminator (see swatches attached), although Starglow has more of a primer-like feeling, which I like. I’m trying to shorten this review, but I just can’t stop saying good things about this Starglow highlighter!",

My already very lightweight foundation became even more sheer so I had to go with powder on top of my cheeks and forehead to get additional coverage. Then, I decided to enhance the highlighter effect and I applied just the Saie highlighter on my cheekbones on top. That didn't work as well because it smudged my foundation.\n\nDay 2 - Decided to mix one pump with my medium/full coverage foundation. It was perfect! I was so happy I got the formula right. My matte full coverage foundation needed that highlighter mixed in. The result was a sheerer foundation with the lightest, most natural glow. I got a compliment on my skin that day.\nThe sparkle is milled so fine that it gives the most natural looking skin.\n\nI would highly recommend this lightweight highlighter if you like a more natural glow. I personally prefer my highlighter to be hardly there.",

Not sure how this would work for super oily folks, but for combo skin it doesn’t seem to turn me into a grease ball. Will def be a staple in my makeup collection from here on out.",

The formula reminds me of a hybrid between Charlotte Tilbury’s Hollywood Flawless Filter and Glow Recipe’s Glow Drops, leaning much closer to the Glow Drops consistency. Glowy Super Gel has a very wet feeling on the skin. It has a much more watery consistency rather than oil or makeup consistency. Definitely gives water gel vibes. Now with that said, I find myself not reaching for this very often because it is too light/sheer and water gel dewy. It seems to water down my foundation too much for my liking. Wearing on top of makeup doesn’t really work for me either. I would consider using this on days I do not want to appear I am wearing makeup, but still want to add a little dew to my skin. I think I may like this product more in the summertime when I my skin is more tan. Overall I do like this product and will continue testing in my routine.",

It looks dark from the outside but it’s actually a light universal champagne color with subtle shimmers. It melts into the skin so easily and gives your complexion a subtle glow depending on how much you use. I’ve tried multiple ways to use this but my favorite way is to use it as a glowy primer that I rub all over my face before applying foundation. It leaves your skin with a nice sheen, and after foundation my face looks pretty dewy, not annoyingly shiny. I’ve tried to mix it directly with foundations as well and it works great, but I prefer to use it as a primer since I like simple steps. I think this is a strong player if you are into the dewy look or if you simply want to dab this on the high points of your cheek bones as a true highlighter. It should be flattering for all skin tones. See my photos for the color payoff.",

When I woke up it was still pretty glowy and looked better as time went on. It definitely stays put. Makes a really pretty highlighter on it's own, and over all skin glow. For me this will either be used just for cheeks or for when I want a nice glow the next day.

Probably not inner eyes, harder to place neatly without a brush...

It has a very subtle natural honey scent that isn’t offensive -it’s just a hint. I love it and I’m sensitive, no issues. It comes out almost watery sheer instead of more thick like CT Hollywood Flawless Filter which has more coverage like a light foundation and more tint shades. The Starglow shade I’m reviewing is translucent. You won’t see a tint on your skin. All you will see is a very natural looking dewy-wet healthy glow. No sparkles, no texture. Truly natural! It dries down moisturizing not greasy or chalky. I put it under and over my foundation and powder. No issues. On the high points of my face (cheek bones etc) it gave me thee most natural looking highlight I’ve ever had. Honestly. I was initially a little worried about the watery sheerness thinking it wouldn’t show up or wreck my makeup, boy was I wrong! This is truly natural for a no makeup look. You get a ton at 30ml (foundation and CT HFF size) so this should last forever. It has a blurring and glowy effect on my chest. And compared to Josie Maran Argan Illuminizer which is more shimmery and solid, again this is far more natural looking and goof-proof. Being a clean ingredient makeup I think this is a solid win and if you are struggling with applying a more natural looking non powder or non thick dewy glow that hydrates which is great for drier skin or the over 40 crowd like me who is drying more and needing more of a dewy glow that doesn’t feel or look like a mask or take forever to blend this is great. I love CT HFF but this is great over powder or liquid foundation whereas CT HFF is a stand alone for coverage. This one won’t give you coverage but won’t be thick over any foundation which is a win in my opinion. My chest looks flawless as this doesn’t apply streaky if you just want to quickly apply it and blend it in. CT is at the top then Saie then Josie Maran for comparison.",

I was able to put it on and then forget about it because it felt like nothing at all - which is how I like my makeup to feel.  As for its effectiveness, it provided highlight in a natural way.  I felt like it reflected the light, rather than being on a high beam.  I enjoyed using this above the brow for a little lift, or below the brow for a little light.  I can also see wearing this in the warmer months on the cheekbone.  If you want a more dramatic look, you could build this.  In my pic, I swiped a thick swatch so you could really see the product.\n\nAs for this being \"clean,\" I think the packaging in very unique.  I do like products that are free from irritants, but I also really like products that can be recycled.  Be sure to check out the sidebar pic on the product page about how to recycle this.

It has a gel like, light texture, as opposed to FuturDrew's oily and heavy texture. Also, this highlighter has pearlescent particles, which helps hydrates the skin and enhance it looks.\n\nIt gives you a subtle glow, without looking greasy or to shiny and gives a healthy look to your skin. It is easy to apply and easy to blend into the skin, whatever colour you choose.\n\nI tried mixing it with my foundation, like they suggested, but it ending up decreasing my coverage. I prefer to wear this alone. With a foundation, I find it makes my skin too oily.",

I have the shade \"Starglow\" and it suits my fair skintone perfectly since it's a very light pearly champagne color.  The formula itself is quite liquidy; I think that I was expecting something similar to the Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter but the consistency is actually much thinner and less opaque.  This can function as a more \"natural\" highlight but I'm actually enjoying using it as a foundation mixer more since it adds a subtle luminosity without looking actually shiny or metallic.  I like the pump top on it as well because it makes dispensing the product easy.  The product really is a good value for the money and I'm absolutely going to enjoy using it.",

The formula is gel-like with very fine pearlescent particles to help enhance the look of skin while it hydrates. I have used it mixed in with my sample of Dior’s face and body foundation in 2N that I find was a little too runny, and the combo works very well and applies without pilling with a brush. \nI would definitely rate this over GlamGlow’s Glowstarter highlighting moisturizer, as that one is thicker, harder to mix with other products and can pill if not careful with the amount of product used. Saie’s highlighter I find to be much more user-friendly and harder to have your finished look become a disco-ball. I am going to enjoy using this product and definitely would repurchase as part of my stash for my base-face!",

Whether bare or with foundation, this provides me with a subtle healthy glow without looking like bronzer or being difficult to blend so I don't look painted. It adds a soft warmth rather than an all out bronze, although it is buildable for a more pronounced color, which I will likely do to enhance a summer sun kissed look. I particularly love that it doesn't look yellow / orange or pink / red as most bronze tinted products do - this is a genuinely neutral tint. I have the Starlight shade and didn't see any need for this but there is definitely a difference and they both provide an amazing lift to my skin, especially for photos where the glow makes my skin look positively radiant.",

It presents beautifully in photos on either bare skin or applied over foundation, giving me an even more natural and subtle luminosity. It could not be easier to use, whether you choose to apply with your fingers or a brush - it melts into skin (or foundation) easily and due to the subtlety of it, it's hard to find a margin where it obviously ends. Definitely buildable if you want a more obvious / less natural finish but at 48 and especially with the dullness that dry, winter weather brings I am all about the way it makes my skin look simply healthy.",

This includes my water based (YSL All Hours & Sephora Clean Glowing Skin) and silicone based (Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk). I am a fan of Glossier’s Futuredew, which lists water as its first ingredient, but is most definitely an oily serum, and does not set. Star Glow, on the other hand, imparts a soft, slightly cool-toned brightening effect to the skin, without feeling or looking just ‘wet.’ It absorbs quickly, too, and does not interfere with my setting powder application. An advantage of the quick-absorbing formula is that I did not find it transferring to clothes. I found this product to be extremely versatile, even using it on my collarbones for lowlight definition. Bonus: it comes in a mini size!\n\nCONS: That being said - it does dilute coverage. After all-day wear, the areas of hyperpigmentation on my skin were quite visible. If you are concerned with coverage, this might not be the best choice for you. I don’t mind it - I just didn’t expect it. \n\nFinal Thoughts: I can see myself finishing this bottle, and trying out another hue. It is an understated alternative to the high-shine glassy look, easily transitioning between, and wearable both day and night.",

        "review_text": "i received this to try and review for Sephora, and initally wasn't exactly sure how to use it, but the very same day @graceatwood (The Stripe) shared her own how to use and review! Long story short, this is not a highlighter -- instead, it gives you a much more subtle \"healthy glow\" and feels like it walks the line between makeup and skincare, since it add glow, but also has Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid in it. The Starglow color was pretty sheer in my opinion, and would work well on a variety of skin tones. \n\nThe best way i can describe this is that it's like an IRL instagram filter. I've experimented with this a few different ways now, and I find that i like using it best as a primer either alone for a no-makeup look, or under makeup for a gorgeous 'lit from within' glow. It's very easy to apply and is glowy without being glittery or shimmery. Its subtle for sure, and is not strobe-like (which is how i think about a true highlighter, which i would NOT put all over my face!) . It smells wonderful (maybe slightly floral, but it dissipates quickly) and isn't heavy at all, and the price is so good for a clean beauty product. 10/10 would buy again, and i'd love to try the more bronze version as well for comparison. Looking forward to taking it on a future vacation for an all-over body glow as well!",

My favorite color is actually the bronze one Sunglow — I'm pretty fair and it gives the most natural wash of sun kissed color. I've been forgoing my powder bronzer for this except for some light contouring with a more dramatic makeup look! As others have mentioned it's a generous size and the pump works great.

It gives a really nice dewy glow to the face without looking like you are wearing any makeup, which could be quite perfect as I typically do not wear makeup day to day.\n\nI’ve tried to use this as a highlighter and also mixed into my foundation. As a highlighter I think it’s just too subtle. And I think it changes the texture of my base products too much for me to want to mix it with my foundation. \n\nMy biggest gripe with this product is the smell. I’m not a huge fan fragranced products but typically don’t mind it if I like the product - but the smell of this is very strong and almost like rotten flowers. I’m not sure if it’s just how the particular fragrance reacting specifically to my skin but the product is a no go for me due to how bad smells. I am still rating it four stars as I think it’s overall a lovely product that I would use otherwise, and could be good for somebody who enjoys the scent.",

My husband thought I need to dry off my face when wearing this alone. I didn't find that the highlight stayed on my skin too well on its own, but it made my skin look much more healthy and radiant. I tried it under foundation as a primer (CT Flawless Airbrush Foundation, Shade 6), and it made the foundation look so much more glowy but not greasy at all. I like mixing this kind of product with my foundation, but I found that since it's so watery, it made my foundation look a little more streaky, and it was harder to get good coverage. I also used it over foundation on the high points on my face, and it looked so gorgeous and lasted on my skin over foundation. The product blends so easily into the skin using fingers, brush, or sponge. I got a lot more coverage with brush and fingers than with the sponge. I highly enjoy this product and would highly recommend it. The shade I got was a good match for me.",

        "review_text": "This is a lightweight, water-based gel with a lovely pearlescent champagne sheen. It can be used as a foundation primer or a highlighter. I was pleasantly surprised with the results when I used this as a primer - first, there's the fresh, luminous glow that it imparts on my face – the “lit from within” descriptor is right - my skin looks healthy, bouncy and radiant; not shiny or greasy. I find for me, half a pump to a full pump is all I need to cover my entire face, depending on how much glow I want, and less if I’m just using it as a highlighter. I also noticed a slight blurring effect with pores and pigmentation from acne scars that I did not expect but am supremely happy with – my pores and dark spots don’t completely disappear, but they are less noticeable.  \n\nI've now used this gel as a primer under a tinted moisturizer, as well as a liquid foundation and a cushion compact, and it’s worked beautifully in each case - zero pilling and my base makeup held up for the day without the need to touch up. The soft, natural radiance from this product really comes through the foundation to brighten my entire complexion. There's a nice slip to this which makes it very easy to apply; and, once applied, it absorbs quickly into the skin, without any tackiness or stickiness. A little goes a long way with this one, so a bottle will last a while.",

The best quality is that I don't need any sort of foundation (unfortunately this forum only allows two pictures). This product lives up to everything it says it is and more! There are SO many glow and luminosity products it's honestly exhausting so I'm am so happy I had the opportunity to try this brand and open my mind to using this as a permanent staple in my routine. In my opinion, anyone, any age can use this and the price point is really good for the results it provides, definitely worth it!",

Mix a little in with any of your favorite foundations, especially higher coverage ones, and it will make it better than you realized it could be. It isn't shimmery and it won't change the texture, but it somehow improves it with a little glow. It also has a very faint fragrance - maybe roses - when you apply it but it doesn't linger. Looks great on facetime and zooms....You can also layer on your cheekbones for some revival if you're feeling like you're looking flat - a little dewiness - not a shimmer.  Try it!",

I was expecting this to be a more dewy finish product with kind of a wet look to it, when in reality this dries down and leaves a very satiny finish. It's definitely not matte but not super dewy - it has a more polished, soft glow look to it. This did not mix super well with moisturizer because of the dry-down quality, I think it will do best on its own as a base layer or under foundation. If you wear it on its own, warning that creme products didn't blend great over this (again) due to the dry-down. I will absolutely wear this under foundation when that's a thing I do regularly again!

It also doesn’t look “unnatural” in that it has a bit of that glow-from-within look, and makes it great for everyday wear. It applies so smoothly and even though it’s a liquid, it feels creamy upon application. It’s also not glittery or shimmery, but more of a sheen. I want to try in the other color next!",

Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate is an awesome Vitamin C derivative , but for 10-11 yr old skin that doesn't require the benefits of vitamin C (increasing collagen production, reducing dark spots, killing free radicals, antioxidizing, etc) it may do more harm than good. Lactic Acid is a form of AHA (chemical exfoliation) known to help improve fine lines and increase new cell turnover. At the ages of 10-11, they really don't need to improve fine lines or increase cell turnover! Their skin is in the prime of doing that naturally and this may interfere! These are in low concentrations in the product & the product has many other great ingredients for young skin, but please be aware!",

I think the drunk elephant has a lot more pigment and is darker than the saie, so if you’re having problems with the drunk elephant showing up, maybe saie won’t be the best option. But I really like these and they give me a very nice glow!! Not too much of a tan though.",

            "answer": "This is a versatile formula and you can use it both ways. Some of the suggested ways to use this are: \r\n- Use one to two pumps and apply after any serum, oil, or moisturizer.\r\n- Mix a few drops into foundation.\r\n- Use it alone for an easy no-makeup moment.\r\n- Prime with it under foundation or tinted SPF.\r\n- Water-based Glowy Super Gel plays well with most foundations as long as they aren’t too oily. If you’re not sure, test it out on your hand.\r\n- Use it for an all-over glow on your face or anywhere you’re bare like your chest, collarbones, shoulders, and legs.\r\n- Can be used over makeup.",

It is a lighter weight fluid texture, whereas the FF is more viscous so the texture is not quite as true-to-skin as the Saie. Also keep in mind that FF comes in skin tones, so you are adding color, and not just glow- which may or may not be what you are looking for. I'm hesitant to call it \"coverage,\" because it isn't really that, but when I wear FF it is like wearing a skin tint with some neutralizing effect. Whereas when I wear Saie it is exclusively for the radiance- not evening out redness or anything like that. Hope this helps you decide which one you want!",
